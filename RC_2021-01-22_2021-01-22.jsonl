Fluoridex is a prescription toothpaste or rinse with fluoride in it that can be a helpful supplement to home care for cavity-prone patients. You will be taking it home and using it yourself. Essentially the point of fluoride is to strengthen your teeth and make it harder for cavities to get in.\n\nIf you want to get your own bottle of Peridex, it is definitely helpful in helping to fight gum disease, but I must warn you that prolonged use of it can/will start to stain your teeth black. Excellent hygiene will help to prevent the staining, and the staining is reversible with a good cleaning, but it's definitely unpleasant.\n\nI haven't heard any arguments against Arestin besides those of my friend, but essentially he feels that it's ineffective. My current understanding is that the research supports its efficacy but I do not have much personal experience with it. \n\nCurrent research shows that scaling and root planing alone can be effective up to 6 mm in depth and that anything beyond that may require additional measures. However, even up to 6 mm it can be technique sensitive. Essentially the deeper the pocket is, the more challenging it is to successfully clean out. Arestin could be a helpful supplementary measure in those cases to help to improve the odds of success.\n\nThe downside of waiting for the follow-up is simply that if the first round of SRP does not show sufficiently improved results, they might want you to go through another round of SRP, this time with the Arestin. I don't feel that waiting for the follow-up carries much risk beyond that. Generally here's how it goes: the general dentist or hygienist will do one round of SRP, wait 4-6 weeks, then re-evaluate. If everything goes well, you can expect a 1-2 mm reduction in pocket depths in most areas. The goal is for no pocket depth to be greater than 4 mm. If there are still depths greater than 4 mm and there is not a marked improvement, then further treatment is indicated. That further treatment could involve re-doing the SRP and adding arestin or referring out to a periodontist (gum specialist).\n\nThis option is not for everyone, but if you are unhappy with the level of care you can afford on Medicaid, you could try going to a dental school or a dental residency program - they should all take Medicaid. At a school you'll be treated by students, which sounds a little scary, but they're being overseen by experienced attending professors who, at least at the school I attended, rarely accept anything short of ideal treatment. And there is still a cost, but nobody is there to make money - the students are there to learn and the professors are there to teach. When I was in school, students were in the back offices arguing with the administrators to try to get discounts/cheaper treatment for their patients. The downside is that the students are very slow and that every phase of treatment takes a long time because they need every step checked by their professors. A residency program will be similar, except the residents treating you are graduated/licensed dentists who are straight out of school.

In fact, there are many cases of people who do not show compressions via MRI\u2019s but when they go in for Microvascular Decompression surgery, there\u2019s quite a LOT of visible compression to the trigeminal nerve that the MRI did not see.  \n\nI was actually diagnosed with trigeminal neuralgia with a relatively normal MRI but I also have very severe migraines. I will tell you your symptoms are spot on with trigeminal neuralgia, not TMJ. I actually went to an orofacial pain specialist because I thought I had TMJ and he told me I did not have TMJ and he thought I may have trigeminal neuralgia. Sure enough, I brought this to the attention of my neuro (who treats my migraines) and they dx after my MRI and discussing my symptoms. The fact that your meds are working is an indicator that you have trigeminal neuralgia. \n\nYou could see an orofacial pain specialist to have them rule out TMJ, this could help you with your official dx. Then I would find a new neurologist to help with your official dx. \n\nNow, for your orthodontia question. This is VERY difficult to answer because it\u2019s truly so different for everyone. Some people with TN can\u2019t even wear night guards, while some people (like me) can tolerate Invisalign very well. I had braces when I was younger but opted for Invisalign this time around. There\u2019s pros and cons to braces and Invisalign. Braces do a MUCH better job moving your teeth and correcting your bite. I was more disappointed with the results of my Invisalign as there are still tiny gaps in my teeth (that only I noticed) but my teeth are straight. Invisalign tends to cause more de-mineralization and I honestly found Invisalign to be more painful than braces, granted I didn\u2019t have trigeminal neuralgia dx when I had braces. But with Invisalign If you\u2019re having a pain flare you can simply pop them out. They were such a pain to constantly brush your teeth every time you ate or drank anything but water though. \n\nIf you do choose braces and you\u2019re concerned about pain, you can request for your ortho to use thinner wires and it\u2019ll create less pressure on your teeth. \n\nAll in all, getting ortho work may actually help with your pain if you have an overbite as it\u2019ll help your jaw properly relax. Plus the self confidence is dope. \n\nBut ultimately discuss it with your neuro and get their input. Maybe even discuss getting some baclofen or another muscle relaxer prescribed if the pain does get intense for you. Good luck!

I just wanted to try to stabilize as well as I have had several days of misery and unable to feel anything but negative side effects and it was killing me. I didn't expect them to end and to find normal again.\n\nI was able to get some sleep and actually felt the kratom I took first time since the downward spiral began. I was surprised. When I got up today I noticed I wasn't in physical torture anymore. I took my baclofen and decided an hour later to try a minute dose of phenibut as I would taper off of that. Bad symptoms occured right after the phenibut and I was backsliding.... So I decided to just cut that out and use baclofen and lyrica to stop it CT. I've done this before.\n\nSo now I am seeing how expensive it is to try to taper using extracts just to save from kratom destroying one's gut.... I am not sure hot I can do it without another stimulus check (d'oh!!)\n\nI do have a scale. I have been using teaspoons for my kratom leaf doses but I am sure whether they were level spoonfuls or whatnot, I am sure each dose was varied by some mg. I really have been ready to quit kratom CT and am wondering if my glutamate storm was from phenibut somehow even though I've taken it daily for like 20 months and couldn't imagine it ever just turning on me. I read to take NAC and agmatine for quitting phenibut so I am doing that. NAC is supposed to help end glutamate storms. \n\nSo I wonder if what I was feeling stopping kratom was enhanced by a glutamate storm? I've recently stopped benzo use so all my GABA receptors both A and B must be blown. Hence why it makes more sense that some GABAergic substance would turn on me. Altho I believe kratom does some GABAergic stuff too.\n\nBut anyway I don't feel normal now, I just feel world's better than yesterday and the days leading up to this post.\n\nThanks for your post!", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "comment_type": null, "created_utc": 1611283992, "gildings": {}, "id": "gk4vcx8", "is_submitter": true, "link_id": "t3_l0a89l", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t1_gk116s2", "permalink": "/r/quittingkratom/comments/l0a89l/kindling_my_life_both_on_and_off_kratom_sucks_now/gk4vcx8/", "retrieved_on": 1611419861, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "quittingkratom", "subreddit_id": "t5_2xty7", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1611283992.0}

The effect on Hp  patients  of  a  Test  fermented  milk  containing  yogurt  and  three Lacticaseibacillus (L. paracasei CNCM I-1518, CNCM I-3689, L. rhamnosus CNCM I-3690) strains was assessed on  antibiotic  associated  diarrhea  (AAD)  (primary  aim),  GI-symptoms,  gut  microbiota composition  and  metabolites.  In  this  aim,  a  randomized,  double-blind,  controlled  trial  was performed in 136 adults under Hp-treatment (14-day amoxicillin, clarithromycin, pantoprazole), who  consumed  the  Test  or  a  Control  product  for  28  days.  Feces  were  analysed  for  gut microbiota composition, short chain fatty acids (SCFA), calprotectin, and viability of ingested strains.  \n\nRESULTS: No effect of Test product was observed on AAD occurrence or duration, rating scores or number of days of GI symptoms. Hp-treatment induced a significant alteration in bacterial  and  fungal  composition,  a  decrease  of  bacterial  count  and  alpha-diversity,  an increase of Candida and of calprotectin, and a decrease of SCFA concentration. Following Hp treatment, in the Test as compared to Control group, intrasubject beta-diversity distance from baseline was lower (p^adj =0.02), Escherichia-Shigella (p^adj =0.0082) and Klebsiella (p^adj = 0.013) were significantly less abundant, and concentrations of major SCFA (p=0.035) and valerate (p = 0.045) were higher. Viable Lp and Lr strains from the Test product were mainly detected during product consumption in feces.  \n\nCONCLUSIONS:  The study showed that 14-day Hp triple therapy alters gut bacterial and fungal community, their metabolites and gut inflammatory markers. Consumption of a multi-strain fermented milk can induce faster recovery of the microbiota composition and SCFA production and limit the bloom of pathobionts", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "comment_type": null, "created_utc": 1611357374, "gildings": {}, "id": "gk99a5c", "is_submitter": true, "link_id": "t3_l2zlq9", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t3_l2zlq9", "permalink": "/r/InflammationStation/comments/l2zlq9/multistrain_fermented_milk_promotes_gut/gk99a5c/", "retrieved_on": 1611502069, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "InflammationStation", "subreddit_id": "t5_2c2cq5", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1611357374.0}

For this reason, reasonable clinical judgment, breakthrough (rescue) opioid regimens, and dose titration are of paramount importance.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;As a clinician, it is important to note that there are significant limitations to equianalgesic conversions and tables. While these equianalgesic tables are current the \"best\" solution, their limitations should be emphasized:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Single-dose studies**: Early studies determining equianalgesia were based on single doses, not chronic administation.[**8**](https://clincalc.com/Opioids/#8) Due to drug accumulation, half-life, tolerance, and active metabolites, subsequent chronic administration studies often vary greatly from the original single-dose data.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Bidirectional conversions**: When converting between certain opioids, the direction of conversion (eg, morphine to hydromorphone versus hydromorphone to morphine) will produce a different conversion ratio. These bidirectional differences are not captured in a traditional equianalgesic table.[**5**](https://clincalc.com/Opioids/#5),[**7**](https://clincalc.com/Opioids/#7)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Dose-dependent conversions**: The conversion ratio of certain opioids can be dependent on the dose of the original opioid. In the case of converting morphine to methadone, methadone has a relative potency of 4:1 at lower morphine doses, but becomes much more potent (12:1) in patients converting from very high morphine doses.[**5**](https://clincalc.com/Opioids/#5),[**7**](https://clincalc.com/Opioids/#7)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Cross-tolerance**: Many references recommend a cross-tolerance reduction between 25-50% when converting between unlike opioids.[**9**](https://clincalc.com/Opioids/#9) In patients with very high opioid requirements, the difference between 25% and 50% can be a very significant discrepancy.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Equianalgesic Discrepancies**: There are significant discrepancies in equianalgesic dosing tables, with even FDA-approved drug labels not demonstrating agreement.[**10**](https://clincalc.com/Opioids/#10) These discrepancies are a factor of both references using old data (single-dose studies) and an overall paucity of data in chronic dosing studies.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Patient-specific factors**: No equianalgesic table is able to take into account patient-specific factors -- primarily hepatic function, renal function, and age. Opioid metabolism and excretion do differ among the opioids; therefore, alterations in drug disposition will alter the relative potencies of different opioids.\n\nwith all their research n knowledge why do u think u would make a calculator better than they do?", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "comment_type": null, "created_utc": 1611339481, "gildings": {}, "id": "gk7rmrs", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_l2t032", "locked": false, "no_follow": false, "parent_id": "t3_l2t032", "permalink": "/r/opiates/comments/l2t032/ratios_for_prescription_opiates/gk7rmrs/", "retrieved_on": 1611476510, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "opiates", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r0y3", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1611339481.0}

Here are a couple of items from the article that caught my eye in terms of concern, but can also be sort of debunked. \n\n1. It has recently been shown that patients who had been treated with finasteride have reduced or undetectable levels of neuroactive steroids in their cerebro-spinal fluid and plasma, and exhibited higher levels of precursor steroids \\[[75](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4064044/#B75)\\].\n\nOk so this guy references an article for this statement. Now, the funny thing is, not a single thing in his reference even discusses finasteride. Nothing. The article at one point does state \" it has been demonstrated that inhibiting the formation of 5\u03b1-reduced steroids during late gestation in rats reduces gestation and the number of viable pups per litter; in addition, it impairs cognitive and neuroendocrine functions in the juvenile offspring\". But nothing about finasteride. Debunked.\n\n2.   Inhibition of 5\u03b1-R by finasteride is thought to contribute to reduced neuroplasticity due to structural changes resulting from inhibition of neurogenesis in the hippocampus. Finasteride treatment in mice showed decreased cell proliferation in the hippocampus, suggesting that inhibitors of 5\u03b1-R blocks neurogenesis \\[[84](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4064044/#B84)\\]. \n\nOk, another reference yay, lets take a look. So in this study, they were basically trying to test finasteride on rats to see if it had an effect on their brain cell generation. The overall result is they saw a 25% decrease of brdU, from which I understand is a neural precursor cell. Basically, less new cells in brain, not very good. Now the glaring problem with this study that I see is, each rat received 100mg/kg of finasteride. You read that right. One. Hundred. Fucking. mg. per. kg. Thats like doing a study saying ingesting caffeine can cause heart attacks but taking the test group is being injected with a kilo of it. Pass.\n\n3.  Therefore inhibition of 5\u03b1-R by finasteride and dutasteride in the course of treatment of nonlife threatening conditions, such as male pattern baldness (alopecia) or BPH may have detrimental effects on the CNS. \n\nThis is another rat study, however this one actually may have some merit, although only a little. So basically the study took these rats that have a progressive neurological disorder called Niemann Pick Type C (NP-C), and studied the levels of neurosteroids in their brains from birth till death. What they found was, as the disease progressed, the levels of 5AR and 3AHSD were being reduced, until they were completely depleted by day 50. The mice typically die at age 70, so basically there is a 20 day window where they have zero of these enzymes in their brain. I'll give it to the study, its a little scary to know that these mice basically died to due lack of neurosteroids in the brain, however I'm not convinced this is the same in humans. \n\n4.  In a mouse model of pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures, there was an approximately 50% decrease in the protective effect of P in mice when treated with finasteride \\[[89](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4064044/#B89)\\]. Higher dosages of finasteride produced more persistent symptoms of pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures \\[[89](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4064044/#B89)\\].  \n\nWell I can't seem to get access to this study to dive into the details, but from face value, they used a whopping 50-300mg/kg on these mice to REALLY inhibit progesterone, the neurosteroid responsible for anti-convulsant activity and seizures. Using this info and trying to compare it to potential adverse effects in humans is just silly. The average weight of a human male is like 65kg. If you were to repeat this study, you'd be taking, at minimum, 3,250mg of finasteride IN ONE DOSE. Thats nearly 9 years worth!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll I'm trying to get at here is, this study is scary at face value, but when you dive into the details of all the studies they are referencing and the conclusions drawn, its pretty apparent they are stretching correlations. I don't doubt 5AR inhibitors effect neurosteroids to some degree, but till I see research or a study showing definitive results in humans, I'll remain skeptical.", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "comment_type": null, "created_utc": 1611304724, "gildings": {}, "id": "gk5p5ls", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_l0pfsw", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t1_gjy3iys", "permalink": "/r/tressless/comments/l0pfsw/who_here_has_had_absolutely_no_side_effects_from/gk5p5ls/", "retrieved_on": 1611438932, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "tressless", "subreddit_id": "t5_2shlm", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1611304724.0}

This is the only kind of representation we're often getting, and that beats no representation.\n\nI know it's hard to picture, but this is exactly what it feels to be gay irl. Everyone assumes you are straight. And in games specifically you can't say \"sorry, I'm gay\" 99.9999% of the time. Hell, often there isn't even an option.\n\nI think lgbt representation *feels* like it's everywhere because it was not there at all in the first place. \n\nI'm not saying you are homophobic or anything, I'm talking in general here. Please don't take it as an attack, I swear I'm not trying to vilify anyone with what I'm about to say:\n\nWhenever privilege is taken away, whoever had it will absolutely feel loss. \n\nIt can't be helped. Because that representation/support/funds/whatever has to come from somewhere. It's natural for straight people to feel like *something* is being taken away, because it is. But it shouldn't have been that way in the first place (in this case 100% representation, 100% of the time).\n\nNow, I agree, some companies jump on the rainbow bandwagon just for marketing purposes, and I hate it when that happens because it's often sloppily done. But I think assuming you are bi in games is a good middle ground. You don't wanna play bi? Well, they can't all be straight since some of us would like the option, right?\n\nTake Mass Effect, for example. For some reason the Asari are all pansexual. No one seems to mind. As a gay guy it feels like they're trying to shove tits in my face, but I get it. Too bad there's no male equivalent though. And yet, if there was, I'm sure straight guys would hate it. See what I mean? Female Shepard can be a lesbian with little to no change in dialogue when romancing female characters, but somehow they felt the need to make specific male homosexual partners for gay Shepards for some reason. Now *that* is pretty jarring. You can't just make Kaidan Alenko suddenly gay for the third installment just because suddenly you thought it was a good idea, and have it also make sense. And sure, tehre is Cortes but he came.out of nowhere and was absolutely a glorified NPC. And yet... at least I was able to have *any* gay guys. \n\nWhat I'm trying to get to is that **messy representation &gt; no representation at all.**\n\nI think if anything we should push for higher quality of representation, so that it's not shoehoerned and it feels organic. On either direction. \n\nBottom line, though, I think that any lgbt character will probably feel a bit like a loss for straight people, because it is. But it can't be helped. The alternative would be all characters being sttaight, and I think we can agree that's not cool.

The only way to prevent AGA from when you\u2019re young is to go on puberty blockers or get straight up castrated if you\u2019re male, or be perpetually pregnant as a female.

Please listen to this feminist professor Mary P Koss explain that a woman raping a man isn't rape. Hear her explain in her own voice just a few years ago - https://clyp.it/uckbtczn. I encourage you to listen to what she is saying. (Really. Listen to it! Think about it from a man's perspective.)\n\nShe is considered the foremost expert on sexual violence in the US. She is the one that started the 1 in 4 American college women is sexually assaulted myth by counting all sorts of things the \"victims\" didn't. A man misinterpreting a situation going in for a kiss and then backing off when she pulls back, puts up her hand, or turns her cheek is counted as a sexual assault on a woman even if she doesn't think it was. As you hear in her own words the woman's studies professor and trusted expert that literally wrote the book on measuring prevalence of sexual violence does not call a woman drugging and riding a man bareback rape ... or even label it sexual assault ... it is merely \"unwanted contact\"\n\nYou see she has been saying this for decades and was instrumental in creating the methodologies most (including the US and many other government agencies around the world) use for gathering rape statistics. E.g.\n\nDetecting the Scope of Rape : A Review of Prevalence Research Methods. Author: Mary P. Koss. Journal of Interpersonal Violence Volume: 8 Issue: 2 Dated: (June 1993) Page: 206\n\nAlthough consideration of male victims is within the scope of the legal statutes, it is important to restrict the term rape to instances where male victims were penetrated by offenders. It is inappropriate to consider as a rape victim a man who engages in unwanted sexual intercourse with a woman.\n\nSrc: http://boysmeneducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Koss-1993-Detecting-the-Scope-of-Rape-a-review-of-prevalence-research-methods-see-p.-206-last-paragraph.pdf\n\nShe is an advisor to the CDC, FBI, Congress, and researchers around the world and promoting the idea that men cannot be raped by women. There was a proposal to explicitly include forced envelopment in the latest FBI update to the definition of rape but after a closed door meeting with her and N.O.W. lobbiests, it mysteriously disappeared. She has many many followers and fellow researchers that follow her methodology and quote her studies. That is where most people get the idea rape is just a man on woman crime. Men are fairly rarely penetrated and it is almost always by another man.\n\nMost people talking about sexual violence refer to the \"rape\" (penetrated) numbers as influenced by Mary Koss's methodologies, but in the US the CDC also gathered the data for \"made to penetrate\" (enveloped) in the 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2015 NISVS studies.\n\nAs an example lets look at the 2011 survey numbers: https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss6308a1.htm\n\nan estimated 1.6% of women (or approximately 1.9 million women) were raped in the 12 months before taking the survey\n\nand\n\nThe case count for men reporting rape in the preceding 12 months was too small to produce a statistically reliable prevalence estimate.\n\nvs\n\nan estimated 1.7% of men were made to penetrate a perpetrator in the 12 months preceding the survey\n\nand\n\nCharacteristics of Sexual Violence Perpetrators For female rape victims, an estimated 99.0% had only male perpetrators. In addition, an estimated 94.7% of female victims of sexual violence other than rape had only male perpetrators. For male victims, the sex of the perpetrator varied by the type of sexual violence experienced. The majority of male rape victims (an estimated 79.3%) had only male perpetrators. For three of the other forms of sexual violence, a majority of male victims had only female perpetrators: being made to penetrate (an estimated 82.6%), sexual coercion (an estimated 80.0%),\n\nSo if made to penetrate happens each year as much as rape then by most people's assumed definition of rape then men are half of rape victims. If 99% of rapists are men and 83% of \"made to penetrators\" are women ... then an estimated 42% of the perpetrators of nonconsensual sex in 2011 were women.\n\nBut since made to penetrate is not rape, the narrative is that men are rapists and women are victims and boys/men that are victims are victims of men. Therefore most of the gender studies folks create programs to teach men not to rape (e.g. r/science/comments/3rmapx/science_ama_series_im_laura_salazar_associate/). Therefore there is justification for having gendered rape support services which means almost none for males victimized by females. These misleading stats are ammo to tell men to shut up about rape because 1 in 5 women are raped vs \"only\" 1 in 71 men and dismiss raped men because men are one group \"nearly all the men were raped by other men\" so somehow raped men are to blame because they are men...\n\nAnd before you think that was just one study, it wasn't. The prior year numbers have been really close between the sexes most years.\n\n2010 survey results - https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/cdc_nisvs_ipv_report_2013_v17_single_a.pdf\n\n2012 survey results - https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/NISVS-StateReportBook.pdf\n\n2015 survey results - https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/2015data-brief508.pdf\n\nScientific American - https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/sexual-victimization-by-women-is-more-common-than-previously-known\n\ndata revealed that over one year, men and women were equally likely to experience nonconsensual sex, and most male victims reported female perpetrators. Over their lifetime, 79 percent of men who were \u201cmade to penetrate\u201d someone else (a form of rape, in the view of most researchers) reported female perpetrators. Likewise, most men who experienced sexual coercion and unwanted sexual contact had female perpetrators.\n\nAnd non CDC study...\n\nA recent study of youth found, strikingly, that females comprise 48 percent of those who self-reported committing rape or attempted rape at age 18-19.\n\nThe Atlantic - https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/11/the-understudied-female-sexual-predator/503492/\n\nAnother non CDC study...\n\na 2014 study of 284 men and boys in college and high school found that 43 percent reported being sexually coerced, with the majority of coercive incidents resulting in unwanted sexual intercourse. Of them, 95 percent reported only female perpetrators.\n\nAnd another non CDC study...\n\nNational Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions found in a sample of 43,000 adults little difference in the sex of self-reported sexual perpetrators. Of those who affirmed that they had \u2018ever forced someone to have sex with you against their will,\u2019 43.6 percent were female and 56.4 percent were male.\u201d\n\nTime - http://time.com/3393442/cdc-rape-numbers\n\nwhen asked about experiences in the last 12 months, men reported being \u201cmade to penetrate\u201d\u2014either by physical force or due to intoxication\u2014at virtually the same rates as women reported rape (both 1.1 percent in 2010, and 1.7 and 1.6 respectively in 2011).\n\nIf my information is not enough, try reading these threads by problem_redditor with lots more studies and references.\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/i0j2g9/some_sources_on_sexual_abuse_of_men_and_boys/\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/i6sdli/some_sources_on_sexual_abuse_of_men_and_boys_part/\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/iavcnv/some_sources_on_sexual_abuse_of_men_and_boys_part/\n\nJust maybe, rape isn't a gendered issue and we should stop treating it like one. But if we acknowledge that, then we would have to point the blame at \"rapists\", rather than \"men\".\n\nAnd it isn't just the US.\n\nFeminists lobbied against gender neutral rape laws in India, so women are not rapists and men victimized by women are not rape victims. https://www.timesofindia.com/india/Activists-join-chorus-against-gender-neutral-rape-laws/articleshow/18840879.cms\n\nSo a woman physically forcing sex on a man is not a rape in India, but a man breaking an engagement after having sex with his fiancee is a rape.\n\nIsraeli feminists were concerned if a woman raping a man was recognized by law, a man could threaten to make false accusations against the woman after the man raped her in order to keep her from reporting. Apparently false accusations are a problem for women, so they fixed this by blocking the legislation that would have made rape a gender neutral crime.\n\nhttps://m.jpost.com/Israel/Womens-groups-Cancel-law-charging-women-with-rape\n\nNepal feminists also blocked legislation there ...\n\nWomen\u2019s rights activists had criticised the draft ordinance saying it wasn\u2019t empathetic towards the plight of the victims. They said that having a provision saying even men could be victims of rape could could further weaken the women rape victims\u2019 fight for justice.\n\nhttps://kathmandupost.com/national/2020/12/11/ordinance-amends-law-on-rape-but-fails-to-recognise-rape-of-boy-child-and-sexual-minorities\n\nEven if you only care about women, you should still stop women from raping because the majority of men convicted of raping women were sexually violated by adult women when they were boys. Multiple studies in the US, UK, and Canada have shown this. Around 10 of them cited here.\n\nhttp://empathygap.uk/?p=1993#_Toc498111528\n\nSo women not raping, and rape by women being acknowledged as traumatic and treated with compassion, would probably stop a lot of women from getting raped in the future.

There may be some economic impact, but as stated before the industry has known this was coming for a few months and doesn't seem shaken.\n\n&gt; Women's sports destroyed\n\nThis is a spicy one. Biden signed at least one executive order concerning discrimination against transgendered people. Among the changes is a statement that organized sports cannot discriminate against transgendered people.\n\nSome argue that a person who transitions from male to female should not be allowed to compete in women's sports. The argument is that testosterone levels in a male physiology promotes muscle development in a way that gives these people an unfair advantage.\n\nOthers argue this isn't always true, and that sometimes the reason a person decides to transition between genders is they are born with a male physiology that has a chemical balance more like a female physiology or vice versa, so the testosterone issue is more of a case-by-case thing than a general problem.\n\nThis has been a subject of debate for a long time in sports, and I don't think we'll see a definitive answer soon. However, I'm going to argue saying women's sports are \"destroyed\" seems hyperbolic. Let's wait and see. My gut tells me if this is disruptive and unfair, organized sports is going to find a way to handle it.\n\n&gt; Troops forced to sleep in parking garages\n\nThis happened but attributing it to Biden seems dubious. [Here's an article](https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/21/politics/national-guard-capitol/index.html). \n\nAs best as I can tell it seems like it's a case of disorganization. The troops were in the Capitol in response to Trump loyalists attacking the building in an attempt to forcibly overturn the election, and they will remain until some point in February. However, because Congress is beginning to meet again Capitol Police became concerned about crowding in the building. So they asked the National Guard to move those rest areas, and a parking garage was used while new rest areas were designated. \n\nThis made a lot of people mad, but it's really hard to say Biden caused this. There's a much straighter line between these circumstances and Trump. This claim doesn't even seem hyperbolic, I think it's just misattributed. One may as well blame Joe Biden for rain.\n\n&gt; Ramping up Middle East wars again already.\n\nI cannot find any evidence to support this claim, unless I'm missing something it's not hyperbole, it's a lie.", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "comment_type": null, "created_utc": 1611346422, "gildings": {}, "id": "gk8e7yz", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_l2tde7", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t3_l2tde7", "permalink": "/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/l2tde7/whats_the_deal_with_biden_losing_60000_jobs/gk8e7yz/", "retrieved_on": 1611486316, "score": 11, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "OutOfTheLoop", "subreddit_id": "t5_2xinb", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1611346422.0}

For decades, the PKK has waged an insurgency in Turkey in the name of Kurdish independence.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The United States hoped the makeup of the SDF, **which was dominated by the YPG but included Arab groups**, would ease Turkey\u2019s concerns. This strategy was inherently flawed, however, given that it was more an exercise in rebranding than a shift in ideology. In 2017, Gen. Raymond Thomas, who led U.S. Special Operations Command at the time, described how the SDF came to get its name.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The U.S. military, noting Turkey\u2019s hostility to the YPG, went to the Kurdish militia and said, \u201c**You\u2019ve got to change your brand. What do you want to call yourself besides the YPG?**\u201d [according to Thomas](https://web.archive.org/web/20201116124041/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVZCIel_2Xw). \u201cWith about a day\u2019s notice, they declared that they were the Syrian Democratic Forces.\u201d  \n&gt;  \n&gt;The YPG and its pro-Kurdish allies remained the [dominating force](https://web.archive.org/web/20201116124041/https://www.newsdeeply.com/syria/articles/2016/01/22/origins-of-the-syrian-democratic-forces-a-primer) in the SDF, and Turkey remained displeased with the U.S. support for the alliance. The United States deflected Turkey\u2019s concerns in the name of combating the Islamic State.\n\n[https://web.archive.org/web/20201116124041if\\_/https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2019/10/07/brief-history-syrian-democratic-forces-kurdish-led-alliance-that-helped-us-defeat-islamic-state/](https://web.archive.org/web/20201116124041if_/https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2019/10/07/brief-history-syrian-democratic-forces-kurdish-led-alliance-that-helped-us-defeat-islamic-state/)\n\nThere are more but I think this should be sufficient.\n\n\\-------\n\n\\- Kurds had struggled and mistreated due to their identities in Turkey, I'm not denying it, no one should deny it. So when I read your comment, all I understand from it is that PKK, therefore its actions, are justified because of Kurdish people's struggles in Turkey. I guess that paragraph needs a rewording or more clarification. It is a bit frustrating to see people's will to discuss the justification of some terrorist organizations kicks in if they are not affected by the actions of the organization.\n\n\\- Acts of terror conducted by governments or terrorist organizations towards civilians are wrong and ends don't justify the means.\n\n\\- Using Kurds as an umbrella term for PKK, YPG, SDF, etc. is unhealthy behaviour. And I don't think that the media does it in good faith. Kurds aren't a homogeneous group that all think alike. It is like using the word \"Arabs\" instead of ISIS. Half of the Kurds in existence live in Turkey and 20% of Turkey's population is Kurds. HDP, the Kurdish party in Turkey got 13.6% of the votes during their best election run.  \n\n\n&gt;In his post-election speech, Demirtas [acknowledged](http://www.bugun.com.tr/muhtesem-bir-zafer-haberi/1681689) that their success was due in part to votes originating outside their core constituency and promised to transform these borrowed votes into heartfelt support for the HDP.\n\n[https://web.archive.org/web/20170914104801/https://carnegieendowment.org/sada/60370](https://web.archive.org/web/20170914104801/https://carnegieendowment.org/sada/60370)\n\nMost of my non-Kurdish friends voted for them in that election.

Is she a woman or a female? If she thinks she is a man, or male, but we as observers do not have access to her interiority, do we see a woman, female, man or male?\n\n&gt;Here's the quote from the article you cited as evidence: \"The consensus among scientists is that all behaviors are phenotypes\u2014complex interactions of both biology and environment\u2014and thus nature vs. nurture is a misleading categorization.\"\n\nNo, that is in support of my argument. All phenotypes, by definition, are genotypes in interaction with their environment. 'Nature vs nurture' is just a reference to that very entanglement. That is, one cannot isolate either from the other. You cannot separate sex from gender. You cannot separate nature from nurture. Perhaps this consensus is that the versus denotes a false dichotomy? Which I uphold. I am merely using 'nature vs nurture' as that debate which is conceptually flawed.\n\n&gt; I think you may be unfamiliar with how the scientific community operates; I invite you to read the papers provided by each of those bodies to support their position, and rebut them with your own evidence, but the burden of proof is on you.\n\nYou're just outsourcing your argument. You don't have an argument and we are handwaving to authorities in support of the conceptually flawed trans theory. [Nature is ideologically corrupted anyways.](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03781-0?s=09) This is a [manufacturing of consent.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing_Consent) Intersectional ideology is primarily political, not scientific.\n\nI would further point out that talking about sexual/gender _expression_ puts us in the realm of art rather than science. What does science know about art, expression? Perhaps some things, but if one wants to develop ones special epistemic knowledge which allows one to express so competently as to produce ethically fine artworks, one does _not_ devise experiments a la the scientific method. .. it's interesting to think of the influence an idea like [the author is dead](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Death_of_the_Author#:~:text=%22The%20Death%20of%20the%20Author,Barthes%20(1915%E2%80%931980) carries within the art world, but within trans theory it may as well be 'the author is law.'\n\n &gt;Dude, this would be incomprehensible rubbish to a clinical psychologist; leave off the gestalt thing. In fact, your whole argument is incomprehensible pseudo intellectualism and appears to have no relevance to the rest of the discussion.

I've already shown you (and you yourself with phenotypes) that gender is an overly reified concept. Grandiose and vulnerable narcissism correspond neatly with penis and testes. Narcissistic disorders are male dominated (30/70) If we look at the toxic masculinity discourse, we find it highly related to NPD. To think of narcissism and masculinity as synonymous reveals a hypothetical _emergent, interior function_ of masculinity.

She has scoliosis and had the surgery to straighten her spine. This surgery almost paralysed and she needed 3 months of rest. \n\nWhen she finally healed and came back to school it was great. We missed her and were glad to have her back but she now carries a pillow with her everywhere she goes due to her chronic pain and she needs it to support her back when it gets too painful. She\u2019s insecure about the pillow, thinking she looks like an idiot and it took a long time to convince her to go out with us for food and to just hang out. \n\nEventually she agreed and we went to a nearby shopping centre where we just bought shit food, and hung out. Coming to the end of the night we were debating whether or not to get a Burger King because my other friend felt a bit sick. We sat nearby the till (it was an entire floor of fast food places not an actual Burger King restaurant) and debated whether we should get one or not. \n\nThere were only two employees working and they were watching us, clearly waiting for us to make a decision and I felt bad because it was late at night and they probably wanted to go home (everywhere else was closed). I tried to hurry my friends up into deciding (their backs were to the employees) but then I noticed the female employee pointing to Sarah and her and her coworker started laughing. \n\nI can\u2019t say for sure that they were laughing at her but from my perspective it really looked like it and it pissed me off. My friends decided to order and went to do it and they saw the worker laughing at Sarah. This obviously upset her and she felt fucking lost. She has social anxiety too which doesn\u2019t make it any better. \n\nI decided to just say \u201clet\u2019s not get food here\u201d but our other friend was insisting we did for some reason idk why. I think she actually liked what was happening she\u2019s always been a bit off with Sarah. We went to order and Sarah found a seat. The employees were trying not to laugh still and when my friend got her food I basically just said \u201cfuck you.\u201d \n\nThey asked what I said and I said \u201cSeriously, go fuck yourselves you fucking pricks.\u201d And then we went to get our seats. I didn\u2019t want Sarah to know I said this because she\u2019d only worry more but our other friend brought it up saying that I was being a shitty person for saying that and that I should respect that they even took our order. I just said I\u2019m not gonna respect people who sit and mock and laugh at my friend for something she can\u2019t fucking control. \n\nThe night ended badly and my friend is acting annoyed at me but honestly Fuck her too. Idk, I really don\u2019t think I was an asshole here but my friend seems to think so but then again she\u2019s always been one to cause unnecessary drama and bullshit when Sarah is around.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Considering the overt support for children in camps and assaults on muslims in the beginning of Trump's presidency and asian people as COVID began, as well as the antiblack police bootlicking that came from this crowd, I personally think there's very little doubt that this movement was a racist one. Even the crowd who was most concerned with pedophilia was OK with these things happening/continued to support Trump regardless.   \n\n\nI also know and acknowledge that there were different levels of participation in the upheaval, and being annoying on social media is not on the level of raiding the capitol. I don't think there's an easy way to quantify the harm that was done though. I am personally lucky enough to have no close friends or family who got caught up in the madness. However, when I hear about people who were/are, the thing that I can't shake is that these people wanted me (female, queer, leftist) dead. They chose actions that would hurt me and people like me, and they did it on purpose. They voted for people who said they would hurt me. And I think that racism was at the heart of it for more of them than anyone would like to think.   \n\n\nIt's hard to say. I just think we need to reconsider who we're prioritizing with our actions and attention.

I see why you would think that. If you check my update, you can see that there are mistrust issues coming from systemic beliefs and rigid thinking on her part that are judging me in ways I am unable to redeem myself.\n\nMy positive actions are shortly recognized, but then forgotten in favor of a stereotype that polarized society says I should be. I neither want to be this stereotype or want to be in a world where polarized thinking governs every topic we discuss together.\n\nThe reason I feel she comes out of therapy feeling wrong is that our female counselor who is someone else other than me is helping her see the rigidity in her thinking. She comes out realizing that she's oversimplifying what's happening in our marriage and also ignoring how I feel on a daily basis. It is mostly productive and I am also given many things I need to work on to be more understanding as she grows.\n\nOur therapist has noticed that my wife is lacking healthy growth goals in her life and is worried this is undermining her self confidence and ability to be intimate and vulnerable in our relationship.\n\nAs for \"keeping up with the Joneses\", I completely agree! I want to stop spending, buying, competing with everyone. My wife seems focused on continuing the rat race. Particularly for her is upgrading to a much larger house with a much larger lot. She wants a fancy home with fancy things as she seems to see this as a signal of success. I think this is largely because it is what her parents do.

But we're talking stereotypes and the stereotypes about women that continue to this day as evidenced by the quotes we're talking about in the original post are that we don't work and thus need to be supported.\n\nThere hasn't generally been a stereotype against women working in most safeish jobs, and feminists haven't been that successful in letting women join armies and dangerous jobs and moving up career ladders. Feminists have mostly been successful pushing women into jobs where there wasn't really much opposition to them being there, though they'd tried to push more women into leadership.\n\n&gt;And we still had to fight for it. There is no evidence to suggest that women would have been given the vote if we didn't fight for it. \n\nThe suffragettes were regarded as violent terrorists.

An inner hardcore of people, some ex-military, who plotted to take hostage or murder our elected officials. They planted bombs elsewhere for diversions, studied the building layout ahead of time, came to the rally equipped with Zip-Ties to restrain their hostages, maybe before \"executing\" them.\n\n2. A wider circle of potentially violent people, some mentally ill and manipulated by Proud Boys, Oathkeepers, etc.\n\n3. A wide outer circle of Trump followers. Maybe they thought they would make an angrily vociferous protest outside the building, straddling the line between peacefully expressing their anger to the lawmakers inside, and intimidating them into voting not to certify Biden's election. Many were probably already fine with breaking in to \"occupy\" and disrupt the certification vote. They could go from chanting that they supported police, now it was time for police to support them, to ripping up a Blue Lives Matter flag they had brought. The mood of the mob changed even in their feeling toward police, and we all know that it soon lead to beatings and murder of a cop.\n\nLines were blurry, as groups 1 and 2 knew ahead of time they could manipulate and whip up group 3, both at the time of the insurrection and via social  media.\n\nFacebook and Twitter were used extensively before Jan. 6 to radicalize and harden the 3rd group, pushing them toward more and more extremist views and toward capability of committing violence as \"Patriots\", in their view, and not as \"Domestic Terrorists\".\n\nSome of the actual planning and logistics of the attack was done on major social media, but a lot was done in the shadows of Parler and more obscure internet or dark web places. \n\nThus, it is vitally necessary for Apple to take Parler off the app store, or to keep Trump from inflaming his followers with a thought he had watching Fox News at 3am.  Groups 1 and 2 will retreat to the dark web to plot their next terror attacks, but they will be cut off from the everyday (but misled) people of group 3, who won't make the effort to seek out this radicalizing material if they can't easily get the gateway drug of an angry Trump tweet or download the Parler app at the Apple App Store.", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "comment_type": null, "created_utc": 1611339128, "gildings": {}, "id": "gk7qd5i", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_l2m93x", "locked": false, "no_follow": false, "parent_id": "t3_l2m93x", "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/l2m93x/cmv_silencing_opposing_viewpoints_is_ultimately/gk7qd5i/", "retrieved_on": 1611475979, "score": 3, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "changemyview", "subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1611339128.0}

That said, a lot of your position *does* stem, at least in my opinion, from common misconceptions about trans women's bodies, and from a basic lack of understanding of the extent to which human sexually dimorphic traits are influenced by hormones; your position is premised upon a satisfyingly straightforward but factually incorrect belief that genotype alone is perfectly predictive of phenotype, and that hormonal changes cannot effect extraordinarily significant physiological changes *without surgical intervention*.\n\nI'll return to that in a moment with citations, etc -- but let me address your other points first.\n\n**On your first assumption**\nI agree with your premises (let's use Dunbar's number, let's say that each trans person is \"out\" to *everyone* in their Dunbar group, and let's say those are the only people who know).\n\nHowever, none of these things support your point, because a) you're trying to extrapolate a binary event to a population frequency, b) dunbar groups are not independent samples and c) dunbar groups are not random samples.\n\n**Background.** If we treat every Dunbar group as being random samples that are collectively exhaustive and mutually exclusive (more on that in b and c), then there is a 0.5% chance that any given person in your Dunbar group is trans; with 150 people in your group, on average, you will have 0.75 people. But you've cited a statistic that goes, \"Know at least one trans person,\" not \"Knows x trans people on average\". Because of the way normal distributions work, many people will know one, somewhat fewer will know 0, somewhat fewer will know 2, and so on. But each person that knows two, or three, or four only counts as \"1\" in the numerator for \"Knows at least one trans person.\" This is more of a nit from a statistician than a big flaw in your argument.\n\n**B) Overlapping samples** If you are in *my* dunbar group, then I am in *your* dunbar group, and so are most of our friends; these are linked probabilities. In other words, all 150 people in the relatively rare group with 3 trans people in it *are much more likely to also have 3 trans people in their own dunbar group*. That means that you now have close to 150 groups where the \"3\" gets turned into a \"1\". To put it another way, even if the samples are *completely* random, each individual has a 0.5% chance of being trans themselves; if they are, they still have a 75% chance of having another trans person in their group. You now have two people who know \"at least one trans person\" ... but if they had never met each other, they would have *still known* \"at least one trans person\", themself.\n\n**C) Dunbar groups are not random**. Do you think the typical trans person is more likely to have friends who are trans than the typical cis person? Do you think the typical LGBT person is more likely to have friends who are trans than the typical straight person? Do you think that the typical social liberal is more likely to have trans friends than the typical social conservative?\n\nOf course, Dunbar groups self select; that's [readily observable](https://www.pewforum.org/2016/09/28/5-vast-majority-of-americans-know-someone-who-is-gay-fewer-know-someone-who-is-transgender/). Now, no offense to GLAAD, but Pew is one of the most reputable polling organizations in the world; I think their \"30% of American adults say they know a trans person\" statistic from 2016 is more reliable (their sampling methods are more robust and their sample size nearly 2.5x larger).\n\nFrom this data, you can see that Jewish people (who are concentrated in metro areas and skew very liberal) are about 2x as likely to know a trans person as white evangelicals; out trans people are clearly *not* randomly distributed across dunbar groups.\n\nAnecdotally, I personally know about 15 trans people; I'd say only 5 or so are in my Dunbar group. I count as \"1 person who knows a trans person.\"\n\nWithout being able to know or estimate the shape of the distribution, I have no way of accurately estimating what number your 75% should be (and neither do you), but the effect would exponentiate, the more distinct the two groups are.\n\nEssentially, because trans people are more likely to befriend those who they like, those who they like are more likely to know them, and those who they do not, much less so; your mathematical points don't apply.\n\n**On to your main point**\n&gt;My point was men who say \"score\" higher on androgyny would have an easier time passing than men would would \"score\" higher on this masculinity scale.\n\nNo disagreements with the fact that sexual dimorphism exists, and is apparent in masculine and feminine faces. No disagreement that, with the presence of male hormones, most male faces look like male faces.\n\nWhere we diverge is the point I raised at the top; you are *seriously* underestimating the efficacy of hormone treatment alone. Say of the sake of argument that 10% of those assigned male at birth are androgynous enough at 25 to \"pass\" as women based solely on clothing. \n\nWhy would I agree to assume that *some portion* of the remaining 90% cannot obtain feminine features without surgical intervention? And why would I agree to assume that the population of trans people isn't disproportionately drawn from the 10%, rather than randomly across the male population? You've done nothing to support these points aside from generalizing from your experience of specifically non-passing trans women, and describing the mean characteristics of the non-trans male and female populations.\n\n[Hormone therapy is highly effective at developing secondary sexual traits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender_hormone_therapy_(male-to-female)#Physical_changes). FTM people grow beards, develop radically more masculine hip to waist ratios, lose facial fat (creating sharper lines), develop male levels of muscle mass, etc. MTF people lose facial hair, develop facial fat (creating softer lines), develop softer skin, lose body hair, grow functioning breasts, nipple, and milk ducts, secrete female pheromones, and develop radically more feminine hip to waist ratios.\n\nWhy on earth would the *development of functioning breasts from hormone therapy alone* not increase that 10% to a higher number? On what evidence are you suggesting that the confluence of these factors alone would not allow the median trans woman, 2 years into hormone therapy, to \"pass\" with her pants on?\n\nYour premise is that the primary reason that trans women do not elect to a particular gender confirming surgery is because they cannot *afford* to. I'm sure that's the case for many of them; but you've done nothing at all to address the fact that many may not elect to have such surgeries because *they do not need to*.\n\nOnly [28%](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6626314/) of trans women have had any gender confirming surgery whatsoever; the vast majority of those with surgeries had bottom surgeries, breast augmentations, or both procedures -- and nothing else. About 3-8% had facial procedures done; less than one percent had any sort of permanent contouring like the hip surgery you mentioned.\n\n54% of trans women said that the desired or had a gender confirming surgery; most who had not had GCS cited income or age as factors preventing them from doing so. If we extrapolate from those who *had* surgery to those who did *not* have surgery, and discount the 1/3 who want bottom surgery only, then we can infer that, of the 26% of trans women who want surgery and have not gotten it, only 17% are interested in a non-genital procedure.\n\nIf 83% of trans women have either had all the non-genital surgical procedures they would like, or do not want any surgical procedures, it's challenging for me to believe it's just because they've fooled themselves about their femininity.\n\nBy the way, 25% of cis women in the us are [currently considering cosmetic surgery](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-realself-survey-nearly-three-in-five-us-women-do-not-know-there-is-a-difference-between-cosmetic-surgeons-and-plastic-surgeons-300895916.html), with rhinoplasties and breast augmentation being the overwhelming favorites ... just like in trans women, outside of genital surgery.\n\n**When you remove \"bottom surgery\" from the list, having had or desiring cosmetic surgery is barely more prevalent among trans women than cis women.**\n\nAgain, sorry to have been a dick before -- but I've had to go through providing this or similar info many times; a lot of people's familiarity with the transition process hasn't been updated since the 70's.", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "comment_type": null, "created_utc": 1611338485, "gildings": {}, "id": "gk7o3gm", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_l188e7", "locked": false, "no_follow": false, "parent_id": "t1_gk6f8h1", "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/l188e7/cmv_there_is_nothing_transphobic_about_not_being/gk7o3gm/", "retrieved_on": 1611475003, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "changemyview", "subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1611338485.0}

If a guy doesnt want the kid, he is a deadbeat\n\nThis point is major. When people talk about reproductive rights, they only ever bring up abortion, because surprise surprise, that's a way to frame the topic as purely a women's issue. But men are completely fucked when it comes to reproductive rights. Even if you remove abortion from the conversation, women still have all the agency here. Whether the woman wants the child or not, she gets to make that choice. But the man is completely beholden to the woman's choice.\n\nIf the woman doesn't want the responsibility or financial burden of a child, she has options even if abortion doesn't exist. Like you mentioned, she can put the child up for adoption or drop it off at a safe haven. She doesn't have to be saddled with that burden if she doesn't want to. But if the man doesn't want the responsibility or financial burden, he had better hope the woman makes a particular choice. Because if she chooses to keep it anyway, and she chooses to go after him for child support, he's on the hook. So as a man, the only way to ensure you don't have to live with the burden of a child you don't want...is to avoid sex altogether. And that's pretty fucked up. The same people who think \"keep your legs closed\" is a misogynistic argument used by pro-life people, are the same people who turn right around and tell men that if they don't want to raise a child, they need to keep it in their pants.\n\nAnd the reverse problem is true as well, which is when the man *does* want to be a father, but he is denied that by the woman. This situation depends on circumstances. But assuming the man and the woman aren't in constant contact, it's possible for the woman to become pregnant by the man, and deliberately choose not to tell him. Then, if she so chooses, she can either raise the child alone, or give it up for adoption without ever letting the man know that he has a child. This is something which people don't even seem to think is fucked up. I feel like it's a pretty common trope in television for a female lead to become pregnant by a man, and then have a series of scenes where she is trying to decide if she's going to tell the father or not, or if she wants him to be in the child's life. Situations like this are never portrayed as the woman being selfish and considering keeping a man's child away from him. It's just portrayed as a woman making a choice for herself, father's rights be damned.\n\nSo if you are a man, whether you *want* a child or *don't* want a child, the decision can be made for you by a woman. Men's reproductive rights are completely lacking.

I am learning something about myself.\n\nI probably will still write what I don\u2019t understand and what I disagree with. However, I hope that my first instinct will be to mourn and hope for better. To mourn the incorrect understandings people have and even more the people and actions that helped them get there. To hope for more, as the author does, that we understand better who God is and how he deals with us and how we can and should relate to each other.\n\nIn the end, I think the author\u2019s problems are real, but the solution/s is/are one or few of multiple, and I disagree that the suggested paths are the best.\n\nThe author either was not taught or did not learn (or both) the things she writes as missing. I have had male pastors and teachers teach me all of the accounts the author suggests she didn\u2019t know until recently. (Or I have read male authors who discuss them.) These things aren\u2019t hidden - they are in Scripture, able to be read at any time and wrestled with.\n\nI do think a lack of environment to ask questions and wrestle with things is wrong. This *may even* be worse - in general - with men leading then women. Is the answer though to ordain women? Or can men be redirected? Can a male-led local church provide the space and support the author desires (or, more importantly, needs)? I believe the answer is yes.\n\nThough, what I really don\u2019t understand is the sections on pronouns and feminine aspects of God. Did God provide the Psalm for us, to reveal something about himself? If so, should we change the pronouns given to us? This sounds disrespectful. And, as the author seems to point out, the meaning can change. We *do* need to interpret Scripture in modern life. Maybe the author and the songwriter have fully thought out the implications of changing pronouns in the Psalm, and maybe it does make sense for today. However, I hesitate very much before making such significant changes.\n\nThe section of feminine aspects of God seems a somewhat strange compilation, including seemingly oddly reinforcing gender roles and stereotyping.\n\nMy understanding is that the *word* for  Spirit in Genesis 1:2 is grammatically female. Does that make the person female? I don\u2019t know enough about Hebrew, but that doesn\u2019t seem to be the case in some other gendered language. I very well could have missed something there though.\n\nMost translations I find seem to indicate that God pants *like* a woman in childbirth in Isa. 42:14. Men can and do do  that. It is a simile. And, in addition, men can birth things - ideas, objects, even people (in some sense). Working hard to \u201cbirth\u201d something has a literal and supreme meaning in women birthing a child, but the image and symbol and figure is often applied to men and women not literally giving birth to a baby. Not that God is \u201ca man,\u201d but this piece seems like a tendency to go too far the *other* direction.\n\nMatt. 23:37 is also a simile. I do very much encourage the nurturing aspects of God, as noted both there and in Ps. 22:9-10. (Though, I am not convinced that that is specifically referencing midwifery.) The author *should* have been taught about those things, should have been able to speak about these things.\n\nThat is my issue with her earlier leaders and teachers. My issue with the piece is what seems to me an assumption that a complimentarian church cannot teach these things well and what seems like a distortion of metaphor simile too far in the *other* direction - that God was and is something he is not, and that a *he* God cannot do those things.", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "comment_type": null, "created_utc": 1611336662, "gildings": {}, "id": "gk7hqve", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_l2rm7b", "locked": false, "no_follow": false, "parent_id": "t3_l2rm7b", "permalink": "/r/Christianity/comments/l2rm7b/confronting_the_churchs_gendering_of_god/gk7hqve/", "retrieved_on": 1611472245, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Christianity", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh6c", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1611336662.0}

For recognizing the experience of being conditioned, as it relates to the ability to set and receive boundaries. I would definitely categorize myself as someone with firm boundaries, a massive improvement from growing up with few/ none. I learned that confrontations are necessary and the basis for accountability and change. You're absolutely right there is mass conditioning of women, for example: confronting a man or even plain ignoring him in public can easily lead to physical violence on his part, especially if he is bigger than you. I don't fear men, and don't hold bias against tall or larger guys. But that doesn't erase the conditioning as it exists. Your self-awareness of your own conditioning is helping to open my eyes and gain understanding.\n\nI did use controversial and extreme language. I hoped that what I inherently saw as a man holding a woman in contempt was obvious to others. The female reporters statement holds true in much of my experience of men with children, legit I know many men folk who have chosen a car over their children. Not paying child support but buying a new car? is just one example. That's the unfortunate reality that I've personally seen, and I can admit that while valid, its an extreme bias. My cousin even does something similar. His stupid Subaru has more money in tints, wheels, suspension, etc, than most average cars total value, but he spends less than an hour everyday with his toddler and elementary age stepson. Conditioning is clearly much more apparent in my functioning than I realized. I can imagine the fucked up messages that boys and men get, combined with an extremely valid mistrust and perhaps fear of cops just for living with melanin in america.

Pregnancy has major side effects for almost all pregnancies\u2014 even women who have less discomfort one time can have a horrible experience the next, and it\u2019s a complete toss up for most women.  Every pregnancy is different is a common saying among women for a reason. \n\n I especially don\u2019t see why you think discomfort in pregnancy = reproductive failure.  Most women have kids *in spite of* the discomfort and risk, and none of them go in expecting lollipops and rainbows.   Women don\u2019t choose to get pregnant because they think it will be pleasurable, lol.  \n\n&gt;Being a short, fat or ugly man doesn't prevent you but sure will make it harder.\n\nYes, for men.  But for women, sagging tits and stretch marks do not actually make it any harder to have sex or have more kids.  For example, for all the men here whine and cry about how worthless and unattractive single mothers supposedly are, some of these women have many children.\n\nAnd even if there were rare cases where a woman becomes unfuckably hideous because of her first pregnancy... well, those women who become hideous hags after one child have already had one more child than most ugly men mostly ever will. Since your personal measure of lifetime success here seems to be the number of children you have, then ugly women who have one child are not failures compared to the ugly men who will never have any.  \n\nAnd besides, stretch marks and saggy boobs and a tummy-pooch that won\u2019t quite go away will not stop men from wanting to fuck you at all.  Again, men will fuck *anything*.  Women don\u2019t become infertile because of stretch marks or saggy boobs\u2014 this is some bad female anatomy here.\n\n&gt;One kid doesn't equate to entire success, \n\nWhy do you assume the natural normal side effects of pregnancy equates to having only one child?  Do you really think women who have a litter of kids never faced any pregnancy risks or side effects or discomforts?  I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve ever met a woman who had a completely comfortable pregnancy, let alone who managed to repeat that experience multiple times!\n\n&gt;Surviving as an infertile individual isn't success.\n\nUm, most women have had children by age 50, and basically all 50 year old women are infertile... being a 50 year old woman with living children is an evolutionary success.\n\nIn fact, it\u2019s actually believed that humans actually evolved menopause precisely because non-fertile grandmothers are so beneficial to the survival of her grandchildren.  An unsexy old infertile lady who had born children is evolutionarily the most successful among women.  \n\nIn contrast, today, it\u2019s the women who worry about saggy boobs and stretch marks and being youthful looking who are more likely to choose not to have children.\n\nBy your logic, then, the most successful women are the ones who ever have children, because they\u2019ll never have saggy post-pregnancy boobs, or pregnancy stretch marks, or pregnancy-related ugliness, whatever you\u2019re thinking of with that.\n\n&gt;In any case you're missing the point, even if men aren't rejecting women with period pain women are still complaining about it and they're heard, and things may start to be done to accommodate for them despite they're clearly defective in some way.\n\nDescribe the actual impact connection here, not just vague things.  Your argument is essentially \u201cwomen are complaining therefore they are evolutionarily failing because they do not have children\u201d, and that argument doesn\u2019t make any sense at all.  Women with excruciating periods are not less selected for, and are not less fertile unless there is some different underlying problem.  Period pain itself is not an issue in most cases.\n\n&gt;And period pain are often linked with PCOS condition that lowers women's fertility. \n\nLoosely only, and many women have painful periods without any underlying issue at all.  So only in some cases, and again, men still do not select for period pain at all.  \n\nAnd also, lower fertility is not zero fertility in many many cases, which is what you\u2019re comparing to with most ugly men, who will never have any chance to have children.  So no, period pain is not a \u201cfailure\u201d state for women.\n\nYes, there are women who are sterile, and for some of them, this is a very sad tragedy... just as there are also men who are sterile. But none of the things you listed are sterility; again, it\u2019s particularly strange you think having a miserable but successful pregnancy equates to reproductive failure, lol, because obviously women who have birthed a child were not sterile. \n\nOf course, there are other forms of success in life than birthing babies, but if it\u2019s genetic success you\u2019re worried about, then sterile women and ugly or sterile men (many men are sterile also, as you should realize) can also contribute to the propagation of their genes by helping support a blood relatives\u2019 children.", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "comment_type": null, "created_utc": 1611335064, "gildings": {}, "id": "gk7c6aj", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_l2jykz", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t1_gk6jui3", "permalink": "/r/PurplePillDebate/comments/l2jykz/womens_failure_and_selection_is_delayed_compared/gk7c6aj/", "retrieved_on": 1611469835, "score": 0, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "PurplePillDebate", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ya42", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1611335064.0}

Ive been in treatment and fighting addiction for 38 yrs,heroin and crack,during this time ive been through many of the services available,detox,rehab NA AA. Admittedly most attempts to get clean failed before they started because I was doing it to avoid jail or being pushed by others,it wasn't until i woke up one day and thought to myself,Ive had enough of this,i want to stop for myself,not my wife who put up with me and supported me for 20 yrs of hell,not my 3 children who had to grow up seeing me out of my face and going without things because I'd spent the money. But I wanted out !! It makes me feel sick reading what ive just said,and believe me thats a sugar coated outline of the truth but addiction is selfish and you can justify anything to yourself,thats why i hope you recognise the importance of what you have done,i wasn't being patronising.

I cant remember the number of councillors or different organisations ive been through,but for me i needed a strong not nieve ,ex addict support worker that i couldnt manipulate, decieve and rap arround my finger,which i was an expert at doing. What im trying to say is,everyone is different and different approaches and different treatments work for different people,there is no easy answer,it was a case of trial and error for me,i was honest and open and said that i didn't feel that they we're the right person for me and could i see someone else,nothing personal,i always felt more comfortable talking to women,until i ended up with a guy,the first time of meeting him i was cocky said i was feeling good and had nothing to chat about,within 20 mins he managed to get me talking about things id locked away for years and i broke down in floods of tears but walked away feeling good,i carried on seeing him for the following 2 years in which he got me on a new methadone treatment programme then subbutex,ive been clean from opiates and crack for 15 yrs now, im now living with my partner who was one of my close female friends,my exwife is still a big part of my life and is still one of my best friends and the reason that im still alive and loving life,my kids still love me and dont hold anything against me. All this happened because after getting clean and seeing things in a different light,i changed things to enable me to move on and do what i wanted to do instead of just existing.  I never thought id reach 40.im now 54 my girlfriend is 36 we've  been mates for 15 yrs but been together for 13 months. I also forgot 1 important thing,i cut everyone associated with that scene out my life. If you or anyone else can take anything away from this story to help .

Men will gladly allow women to sleep with women or their wives to sleep with women but are disgusted by cucks for doing the same. Both are disgusting cucky behavior and is cheating. This sexual degeneracy is disgusting/gross/nauseating and men are in support of it while denouncing sexual degeneracy in general (looking at you Christcucks/Tradcucks). \n\nI dislike male-on-male competition and douchebaggery in the presence of women. Men put down other men when women/a woman is present. I never act this way and I disapprove of women's presence in a male space or group dominated by males. When a woman is invited in a male only group/space, I leave. Women disturb the fabric of the male space and men tend to encourage this disturbance. Idiots. \n\n\nI dislike men's automatic alliance/siding with women over men. Taking sides with women and never waiting long enough to know whether or not the man was in fact in the wrong. But if he knows the woman is wrong, he is lenient. Men are guilty until proven innocent and get butthurt when individual men are made to be guilty until proven innocent.\n\n\nI dislike that men do not have standards, whether physical and sexual standards or moral standards.\n\nI dislike that men do not have honor these days. Honorable men are rare.\n\nI dislike male gossiping. Men do gossip and backbite, which is just as brutal and venomous as women's. Most men have shitty character, cannot be trusted, and are willing to throw others under the bus to save their skin.\n\nI dislike men thinking they are actually smart/intelligent because they are men and because they are \"free thinkers\".

Yet as we re-emerge, helped by vaccines, we shouldn\u2019t be aiming at \u201cnormal.\u201d We should be aiming at a greener future, a more digital future, a gender equal future.\n\nOff to a good start...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;That means reaching out and bringing women to the table. It\u2019s been said that women\u2019s rights are human rights. Similarly, women\u2019s contribution are human contributions, lifting all people to a place where they can see a better future.\n\n... nevermind.\n\nSince when were women's rights not considered human rights? Considering that our species are gynocentric to a fault, I'd say more men have their human rights violated that women not having them \"considered\" as human to begin with (If that was even true in the slightest).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;The silent funerals with a sad scattering of masked mourners testify that more men than women are dying from the virus. This gender differential increases with age: older men are dying from the virus in greater numbers than older women. We must examine and learn why, and do what we can to keep each other safe.\n\nThey looked at the numbers. That's quite impressive considering everything they've done so far.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;We must learn from the last crisis and ensure that the post COVID-19 recovery funds take account of gender bias.\n\nWhat \"gender bias\"? FAMILIES were hit in this damned pandemic, not GENDERS.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Building and construction is a swift way to turn an economy around, but it leaves women behind, as men generally tend to do the constructing.\n\nDid you see a meaningful percentage of female participation in any sort of recovery efforts after a large period of distraught? I'd say no, and now they want to pay them to sit back and defund those who DO actually do something? Credit them with rebuilding \"society\" while they sit back and relax?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;We must put women at the front this time. As the Commission examines the national action plans for these recovery funds, we must ensure that they are inclusive of women.\n\nHow exactly are they going to fund them, anyway? I spent a solid 10 minutes thinking of an example for this, but I couldn't.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Because when women lose paid employment, they lose just one of their jobs. They go home and go back to their second job, and their third job: caring.\n\nBecause GOD FORBID they have children.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;We know the stories over the past few months: women struggling to find time to sleep in between working, caring for family, home-schooling and housework.\n\nI do not want to spit on the faces of those who genuinely want a good life for themselves and their children, but it is their fault to a certain extent. Why is the father not in the picture? Why do they overwork themselves so much despite having so much support? What is going on?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;We must be crystal clear: working from home is not a substitute for childcare. Implementation of the Work-Life Balance Directive will be required to change this, but I believe that the EU can do more, harnessing EU funds for care infrastructure, collecting data on the situation of carers across the EU and sharing best practices. We need the European Commission to put forward a proposal for a European Care Strategy.\n\nAimed at women, obviously. We need men to keep working till their deaths as usual.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;But work, home-schooling, pastimes and housework are not all that goes on behind the closed doors of families in lockdown. The truth is that children and women, particularly, are imprisoned with the violent.\n\nEyy. Here comes the domestic violence!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Member States must pivot services to help and support them, ensuring that law enforcement and the courts have their backs, but also that civil society can provide the essential services of phone lines and shelters. It can\u2019t wait, this shadow pandemic.\n\nThe law and courts have their backs alright... when it comes to literally any allegation. I can't believe they want to piggyback their own agenda off this damned pandemic so much. Well, I would too, if a chance like this presented itself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;The EU must also move forward with its own actions to combat violence against women, ratifying the Istanbul Convention, adding violence against women to the list of Eurocrimes and putting in place a strong legal framework to tackle all forms of gender based violence. Women are dying. We must intervene.\n\nAnd the men? What about the female domestic abusers? Do they get their just deserts as well or are they lumped in with the rest of the \"dying\" women?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Without implementation, a report is just words on paper. Today I asked the European Commission and the Council on behalf of all the Member States to examine the report carefully and to act upon its recommendations.

The concept of gender identity isn't entirely his, and it has useful applications for academics. That teens are using it to grapple with the confusing task of establishing their identity and our laws haven't caught up with shitty parents, doctors, and others abusing the concept and potentially making horrible choices sucks, but...\n\nThey do that shit with cars, and guns, and religion too.\n\nWe have an entire political party pushing against mask wearing during a pandemic, and I had family die because of that shit.

I live with nerve issues, mostly in my lower body, I have Fibromyalgia, ocular problems, gastric issues and mental health problems.\n\nSo first off let's start with the fibro. Fibro is hell. Your pain scale is skewed. What may be a 5 or 6 for us maybe a 7 or 8 for you. And that's with meds. Being on the 5 or 6 part of the pain scale maybe a good day. Imagine the worst flu you had, the muscular aches, the headaches, the tiredness. That's day to day. That's a normal day. The tiredness and pain never go. You could have slept 10-12 hours and be so damn exhausted it feels like your body is gonna constantly give out. It feels like you're encased in concrete. Every day you gotta trade off what you can do vs how much pain and how tired it's gonna make you. Doing something as simple as cleaning a room could put you out for a few hours. You have varying levels of brain fog, simple tasks become a monumental mental drain, you forget simple shit, you can forget words or actions. Doing things you do everyday can be so taxing, focusing is hard, your brain and body don't wanna cooperate. Every day. That's just the physical exhaustion, the pain can be immense. It might not just be pain though, your senses fuck you over. Your skin can feel like it's on fire and hurts to the point clothes can be painful to wear. Every day is a fucking struggle to be alive. Yeah you wake up and exist, but some days it's to painful to truly live. It fucks with you, on your good days you question whether the bad was really that bad, or were you just wallowing in your pain. Then you have the extra game of 'is this fibro or do I have to see a doctor rn'. Fibro has such a wide umbrella of symptoms besides the pain and fatigue. You play Russian roulette every time trying to figure if this new thing that popped up is fibro or if it's something that needs to be looked into. Then there's the idiotic comments. If like me, fibro has disabled you to the point of not being able to work, you get the 'I wish I could sit at home and do nothing all day' 'oooh I get aches like that' ' I get tired too' all because we don't try and make what we go through seem worse, but less. We have to compete with armchair psychologists and Google doctors telling you to try essential oils, yoga and the latest fad diet. How their far flung family member had it then they started running 15 miles a day, bathed in the blood of vestal Virginia and shoved kale up their ass and were cured. You also have the dick head doctors who don't believe you, think you're drug seeking. If your female, we'll you're just being a hysterical hypochondriac, if you a male, well just man up and deal. Yet people pester Corpse as to why he won't play/stream certain games, why he's not posting vids often. Fuck off with your ableist bullshit\n\nDigestive issues.  You ever swallowed battery acid? That's GERD. It's heart burn and acid reflux on crack. You gotta figure if what you're about to eat or drink is worth the pain of your stomach acid coming up your esophagus and burning everything in its path. Wanna see how bad it affects Corpse? Go watch one of his first videos. His voice was not as deep or as fried as it is now. Years of trading food and drink for acid burning pain has given him the deep raspy voice you love so much. You simp for that shit and call him daddy. You realise you're approving years of pain. Your saying it's fine he has other complications, has a higher risk for throat, laryngeal and stomach cancers because he has a deep voice? Fuck off with that bull shit. He also has mentioned issues with sleep apnoea and a small trachea. Ever had the fantasy of dying peacefully in your sleep? What about suffocating because your body can't support is own airway whilst you sleep? Every time he gets in his bed he must wonder if tonight is the night his airways close over and suffocates in his sleep because he can't maintain his airway. \n\nCorpses wonderful personality that we love so much. Years of family issues. People with mental health issues spend a good portion of their time raising everyone else and making them smile because most days they struggle too. Depression is an evil Jiminny Cricket sat on your shoulder telling you your not good enough, no one really cares and you'll never be worthy. It tells you that your not depressed, you're just lazy and useless. People have stalked him, threatened him, pestered to reveal himself, it wouldn't surprise me if people have tried to doxx him, and they wonder why he is agoraphobic. \n\nLife like this is hard enough without the pressure of having any level of fame or societal pressure beyond the norm. Dont simp his voice and sexualise his pain, don't pester him to continually post vids when he lives in a world full of indescribable pain. Stop fucking asking for a face reveal. Your making the issue worse. He's not beholden to you, he doesn't have to cater to your curiosity at the expense of his privacy and mental health. \n\nI'm aware that whilst we share quite a few medical issues they aren't identical and every issue is individualistic but it passes me off endlessly to see people going ape for his voice that's the  result of many years of pain. People pushing to invade his privacy at the expense of his mental health and whining for more videos from a man who's endured more pain in his 20 something years than you could ever deal with. \n\nIn stead of pestering, simping and invading, how's about you fucking brighten his day with your superchats and comments. Lift him the fuck up because there's gonna be days where he needs them. If you think you see him, pass him by. Don't question the person you think is Corpse on the street or take pictures/videos.

Particularly because, um, to be blunt a lot of the stuff you just said there is wrong. Like, for example, the article you linked is *not* about mutations or \"genetic traits modifying themselves\" in elephants. It's about certain genes being *literally removed from the gene pool* by poaching. That is NOT natural selection and not a good example for your point. It's like a handful of generations of elephants? Evolution straight up does not work that fast. \n\nSimilarly, you're right that humans *are* evolutionarily wired to find babies cute - but not because they are \"feminine and delicate\" (which is a pretty vague and broad thing and how would you even define that?). It is due specific traits found in babies *but not in grown adults* like (proportionately) large heads, which is also why we often find the young of other species cute. [Here is an article which discusses this a bit further](https://www.bbcearth.com/blog/?article=the-code-for-cuteness). You'll notice that these are traits common to infants and young animals in general, not to mature adult women. So if there is any preference for frailty and delicacy in women it's not anything to do with humans being wired to like infants.\n\nIf anything, \"delicacy\" and \"frailty\" in women should be selected AGAINST - because you know what delicacy and frailty often result in? Death by childbirth. As well as general low survival rate because pre-history humans likely lived a fairly nomadic lifestyle and had to be able to travel around, which requires strength and stamina. Women would need to lead an active lifestyle and be physically fit as a result. [There's also evidence suggesting that women were a significant part of hunting activities](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2020/11/prehistoric-female-hunter-discovery-upends-gender-role-assumptions/) which again, um, does not really support your idea that women have evolved to be \"frail and delicate\" in order to find a man to take care of them and their children. Remember that the idea of a nuclear family, male breadwinner and female child-rearer, is a modern invention. Pre-historical women didn't have to find one (1) man to take care of them because they were in a community where people cooperated with each other, and in which case, the division of labour between hunting and child-rearing/gathering would most likely be done on the basis of physical fitness - early humans were primarily endurance hunters so the average biological strength difference between genders would not have been so huge a factor as to prevent fit women from assisting, at least - whereas those who were physically more weak would be more involved in gathering or child-rearing. Which yeah could include nursing women or women who were weaker than needed for hunting or whatever, but would also, like, involve older or injured members of the group of any gender. A physically active and fit woman aged 20-30 is very possibly going to be a better hunter than an older man 40-50. It doesn't make sense to strictly define these roles by gender alone.\n\nWomen being attracted to feminine men is also a social or cultural influence and not ingrained by \"evolution\". Standards for what is considered \"masculine beauty\" can be very, very different in different societies and periods. In the communities I grew up in, for example, pretty boys would NOT be considered attractive by most women at all and were often bullied by boys and girls alike, because in northern Europe and America (and likely elsewhere but I'm not confident enough to state that definitively) feminine men are associated with homosexuality (whether or not they are actually LGBT) and homophobia means that feminine men and feminity in men is heavily stigmatised. Asserting that \"pretty boys\" are just as attractive to women as masculine men as a broad statement is simply untrue. That is something that might be different where you are from and perhaps women being attracted to feminine men is quite common or feminine men might even be viewed as more desirable! But that just goes to show it is NOT an evolutionary trait but a cultural trait because I can assure you that that is not the case everywhere. \n\nI don't want to present the idea that I'm an expert, because I'm really not, I've just read up on this topic a little because it's of interest to me - but that's exactly why I think it's, uh, hazardous at best for amateurs to try to explain modern human behaviours in terms of \"evolution\". Humans are incredibly complex creatures with complex behaviours and even experts in the field still argue a lot over which traits are evolutionary and which traits which are socially learned. Especially when it comes down to things as complex as attraction, gender roles, and gender presentation, I think making firm statements that XYZ is because of evolution is unwise.", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "comment_type": null, "created_utc": 1611322998, "gildings": {}, "id": "gk6aesm", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_l2hti2", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t1_gk5t1v0", "permalink": "/r/FanFiction/comments/l2hti2/pet_peeve_writers_who_bash_masculinity_in_fan/gk6aesm/", "retrieved_on": 1611452172, "score": 3, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "FanFiction", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r5kb", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1611322998.0}

They have to charge for public toliets now. Th outcome of that was the fast food places (Like McDonalds) need bouncers on the doors all day because the homeless come in to shoot up in the toliets.\n\nNow they just tend to shoot up in the doorways of abandonded building or take over the building completly since the companys / shops closed because of amazon being able to out perfom them and the area is so full of junkies nobody would go there to shop.\n\nThe problem with the homeless people here is that there is something like in the region of 85%+ of them are addicted to class A substances eg herion, crack etc.. etc..\n\nThe problem can't just be fixed by giving them a place to live. They tried that they demolosied the buildings seeling the materials to local builders for drug money.\n\nThere is a real serious problem happening to the next generation of people in this country.... A growing percentage of them are basically completly dysfunction in life as they have been raised in that way and the main symtom of that is homelessness.\n\nSo in order to tackle the homless problem the people actually needed the intervention steps way before it occured in their life eg while they were teenagers.\n\nA lot of the problem is actually the original social policies designed to actually prevent this situation in the first place. But they were treated as \"a solution\" rather than a short term patch by the state.\n\nEffectivly what happened in the UK is the same as what is happening in black america. The social policies resulted in a massive growth of single mothers. Mostly because the social policy basically encoraged them financially to have kids and not work in life. So because they have no real work ethic no work ethic has been passed onto the next generation in a significant number of cases and also because the benfifits / policies stop the moment the person turns 18 they get basically thrown out of their own house by their single mother who can no longer afford to keep them and led to fend for themselves. But because they actually have no real life skills.. Either they choose a route similar to their mother if they are female.... (make the problem worse by repeating it). But if they are male they are basically \"fucked\" in life as they have no life skills and nobody to help them so the result is they end up on the street and when people end up on the street they are there normally for a few reasons mostly involving drugs, alcohol and mental health problems.\n\nThis is also not a popular opinion so people deny that it is occuring. But its what the data shows. The UK date shows that 75+% of homeless came from a single parent family (The USA data show the same) and there is 85+% drug addition rate and males make up over 85+% of the homeless. Basically the women have options for bailout in this situation eg they meet a guy and the guy take them on.... Or they get pregnant and make the same choice as their mother did funding them life by child support etc...\n\nWhats worse is the people don't even admit that its a significant contributing cause of the problem until very recently cause they are arguing politics and pushing various narrative's rather than causality, symtoms and solutions.

This was the result of invasions or migrations of the Yamnaya culture.\n\n  \"The Yamnaya were nomadic pastoralists who originally lived on the steppes of Eurasia before moving west. \"  \"The Yamnaya who invaded Europe appear to have been mostly male. The male to female ratio may have been as high as 14 to 1. Because of this, it is not unreasonable to suggest that the Yamnaya men coming into the region were mostly warriors.

If you\u2019ve seen what successful VTubers put together, it clearly isn\u2019t easy.\n\n2. There is a great deal of demand for male streamers.

Vulnerability in a relationship is essential - you need to be able to show your true self to your partner, including your anxieties and insecurities and concerns. In a healthy relationship, you\u2019ll be able to share this with your partner and trust that they won\u2019t shrink away or leave you, but rather comfort you and support you while you work through things and find ways to manage whatever baggage you might have. Vulnerability is strength, your own and that of your relationship - to bare the innermost parts of your mind and emotions to another person, and to trust them with that, is incredibly difficult and takes a lot of courage.\n\nFragility is the opposite - it\u2019s projecting a false image of strength in ways that don\u2019t put you at real risk, so you can avoid facing the reality that you might not be the person you think you are. When people say \u201cmale fragility\u201d this is normally what they mean - guys who emphasize external markers of \u201csuccess\u201d or \u201calpha\u201d masculinity as signs that they have their shit together, to cover up the fact that they\u2019re actually full of a sense of inadequacy that they maybe haven\u2019t directly addressed in their entire lives. People who are truly confident and happy in themselves don\u2019t worry that others will reject them if they can\u2019t somehow prove their worth in qualifiable ways - they trust that they are likeable, valuable, interesting people in their own right and that if somebody chooses not to be with them, it\u2019s not because they somehow failed to measure up or fulfil the role that they\u2019re \u201csupposed\u201d to fill in a relationship. In particular, fragile masculinity is based on having a sense of control or superiority over others, especially women and people of marginalized genders. I know you don\u2019t meant it in a dick way, but the feeling that you\u2019re somehow emasculated by your female partner earning more than you is an emotion rooted in fragile masculinity. Why does it matter if you earn less, or are less financially successful than her? Would you think she was somehow inadequate if you earned more than her, or would that be different because she\u2019s female? \n\nI think the people suggesting individual therapy are right. You sound like you\u2019ve scored a great partner who you really care about and you\u2019re struggling to process the fact that her being so great has brought up a sense of inadequacy about the state of your own life in comparison to hers. It\u2019s often especially difficult for men who are raised with social expectations that they provide a sense of emotional and material security for women, and in exchange they get loyalty and love and sex etc. You\u2019re now in a situation where the roles are somewhat reversed, and that\u2019s left you in a bind because you don\u2019t know how to create a sense of self-worth in your relationship when the traditional ways that you\u2019d do that are not really available, or even needed. I think it\u2019s worth trying to unpack this with a therapist - why do you feel like your partner would only want to stay with you if you can fulfil these traditional roles of protector and provider? If the roles were reversed, and you were the one with the dope career and house and your girlfriend was unable to equal that but supported you with care and attention as your are with her, how would you feel about that? Would you worry she was a gold digger, or would you be OK with it? And if it\u2019s the latter, why is it ok for her but not you? You clearly love this girl and she seems pretty into you, and yet you\u2019re worried that she\u2019ll just wake up one day and decide you\u2019re disposable. But isn\u2019t that the same in any relationship? Like literally my husband could walk in right now and tell me he didn\u2019t love me, and I wouldn\u2019t want my answer to be \u201cWell I\u2019m the main earner in our house so you basically have to stay because you depend on me?\u201d I understand your fear but do you really want the basis of your partner\u2019s commitment to you to stand on the fact that you bring irreplaceable benefits to their life that they\u2019re too scared to lose? If it was me, I\u2019d rather be with someone who I know would be absolutely fine without me, but chooses to love and stay with me anyway because they truly want me in their life.\n\nLong story short, I think you should work with a professional to unpack why you feel like this the only way you can achieve security in your relationship. I do understand where you\u2019re coming from, but wanting to build security in your relationship has to come from mutual trust between emotionally open adults- from choosing your partner every day and trusting them to choose you as well. You will never have a healthy relationship with anyone, if you\u2019re looking to create a situation where you have total certainty on and control of their ability to ever leave you. The only way you can have that certainty is to make your partner emotionally or materially dependent on you for their survival and honestly, that\u2019s a shortcut to an abusive situation.

Normally, I don't really play the ones on this subreddit, cause the content is a bit, shall we say, *distracting*. In this regard, I much prefer the other subreddit, and yet I still come here in the hopes of good CYOAs that can catch the attention beyond just the sexual content. I feel like this one manages that splendidly, and I really appreciate the conversion to interactive format as it makes it so much easier to test different build setups. After trying several setups and failing to make a Kitsune build work with what I wanted to accomplish, I came up with this thing. It makes use of Ubermensch to gain extra points out of certain drawbacks while gaining effects I would normally have bought, effectively giving me what I wanted and then some. For example, Mazoku grants Demon Core, which costs 40 points, as well as makes horns grant an extra 10 points. This is, effectively, 50 points worth for 45 points. Similar effects can be seen in my use of Reaper and Kotengu. I grabbed Changeling in order to console myself and pretend that this is a Kitsune build, although it did require a bit of point reworking to manage it. A lot of my drawback options were compromises on what I'm willing to deal with to afford what I desire in this build. There's too many to go over all of them, so I'll just talk about a couple. The Bizarre Demeanour had to be done for the Jojo reference, of course, and the Chuuni setup is an absolute win in my book. The one drawback I was most hesitant about getting, though, was The Adoring Fan. Yanderes, while ok in anime, are kinda... On another note, I chose Mastema's afterlife because it was the most chill sounding without having to pay for it. It also gave a few free things I wanted, so that's always good. I chose 1 year respawn, followed by Equivalent Exchange and Death Parade because, as far as I'm concerned, lazing around in a slice of life setting for a few centuries isn't really a drawback. Besides which, if I play my cards right, phylactery should make it unlikely for me to experience true death all that often. Chosen is just a given if you want to be anything special, gives so much. Judgement should be fine as long as you don't do shitty things. Next, we have Class Proficiency, and for this, I focused my attention at first on maxing Alchemy, Smithing, and Arcane. Alchemy, as I've learned from Elder Scrolls, is absolutely broken, shortly followed by any enchanting skills. While this CYOA doesn't have enchanting, it does have a crafting skill in the form of Smithing, which at tier 4 makes things that might as well be enchanted. Arcane magic is described as the building blocks of all other magic, which is always nice to know. I followed this up with getting a good amount of Strategy, can never have enough critical thinking, a well rounded physical stat setup, Light magic, as that magic is very good support, Spatial magic, as teleportation is fun, and all the free stats I got. From there I went to Boons, grabbed Permanence and Bio-Immortality without much hassle, obtained my freebies from Mastema, slapped in Aura's Veil to defend against anyone after Demon Cores, slapped in Unbreakable Mind and Lucky, grabbed my Hero and Demon Lord stuff so I could actually assign tier 4 and 5 stats, grabbed transmog so Exhibitionism doesn't bite me in the ass, and then grabbed age shift for the hell of it. From here we go to items, where I have Servant, who I will totally make into some sort of combat 5 body guard, Soulbound that Servant so I always have a loyal companion, grab my free riftgate, grabbed a castle cause who doesn't want to live in luxury, Service so I don't have to actually deal with the cost of living in luxury, Solar Charger, Switch, and It's Only Game to satisfy my inner gamer, and Survival Guide, because I didn't know what else to do with two points. Finally, I chose Oni Overlord as the \"Where to Start\" quest because vidya buddy. It was either that or save the princess, given I could only select one of them in the interactive thing. Would try to do both if that's an option.", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "comment_type": null, "created_utc": 1611310759, "gildings": {}, "id": "gk5v614", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_kulvug", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t3_kulvug", "permalink": "/r/nsfwcyoa/comments/kulvug/project_harahel_v05_interactive_cyoa/gk5v614/", "retrieved_on": 1611442753, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "nsfwcyoa", "subreddit_id": "t5_3h5ee", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1611310759.0}

Because he violated her he shall not be permitted to divorce her as long as he lives.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Shall is a requirement. It is not optional.\n\nDespite shall showing up in Exodus 22:16-17 and there still was choice involved, reading the context of the passage shows that the \"shall\" does not apply to the woman and neither does it show that there is force on the women's side, rather its specifically talking about the man and that he \"shall\" marry her and he has no choice in the matter; it does not denote that she is to be forced to marry him against her will and her fathers will, rather, all it shows is that the man has no choice in this as it follows:\n\n&gt;He must marry the young woman, for *he* has violated her. *He* can never divorce her as long as he lives.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;[Here's a very short commentary on it if you're interested](https://www.biblestudytools.com/commentaries/gills-exposition-of-the-bible/deuteronomy-22-29.html)\n\nI think we can agree that the Bible doesn't go into specifics enough to have full knowledge on the cultural context(as it was written to a certain culture who knew more things than is recorded, and as the laws and regulations do not go into specifics) but I think when we have examples of prominent figures like David asking Abigail to marry him or Rebekah not being forced or even when we have a passage like Gen 24:5-8:\n\n&gt;\"The servant asked \\[Isaac\\], \u201cWhat if the woman is unwilling to come back with me to this land? Shall I then take your son back to the country you came from?\"...\"If the woman is unwilling to come back with you, then you will be released from this oath of mine. Only do not take my son back there.\u201d\n\nI believe we can conclude that women certainly had more choice than the Bible makes aware.\n\n&gt;Then, it is rape, as I have been claiming... Again, shall. This is a requirement. The man has an option, the captive female sex slave is raped and married with no say at all in this. I fail to see how you can interpret it otherwise.\n\nIt certainly does not follow that since it says \"shall\" then it is forced:\n\n&gt;[As it turns out, \u201cshall\u201d is not a word of obligation.\u00a0 ](https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/plain_language/articles/mandatory/)The [Supreme Court of the United States ruled](http://www.ncsl.org/legislators-staff/legislative-staff/research-editorial-legal-and-committee-staff/volume-xxvi-issue-2-the-false-imperative.aspx) that \u201cshall\u201d really means \u201cmay\u201d \u2013 quite a surprise to attorneys who were taught in law school that \u201cshall\u201d means \u201cmust\u201d.\u00a0\u00a0 In fact, \u201cmust\u201d is the only word that imposes a legal obligation that something is mandatory. Also, \u201cmust not\u201d are the only words that say something is prohibited.\u00a0\n\nI certainly acknowledge that this is a modern explanation, however the point is that shall does not denote *force* or *no choice* rather it denotes *what will follow*. Which could easily mean that the woman agreed to marry the man in which she shall be his wife.\n\nThe Bible once again doesn't go into specifics *however* it certainly does not denote rape ***especially*** since in the following chapter, God specifically says rape is a sin deserving death:\n\n&gt;Do nothing to the woman; she has committed no sin deserving death. This case \\[rape\\] is like that of someone who attacks and murders a neighbor, (Deut 22:26 with me adding the brackets)\n\n(space)\n\n&gt;I don't agree with the all one way or the other. What if God is only mostly evil or half-evil. Should you support such a god?\n\nCould a maximally great God be lacking in an area (75% good but only 35% bad or visa versa)?\n\n&gt;(space)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Should you support a god who drowns infants, kittens, and puppies? How about a god who nukes whole cities including infants? How about a god who sends bears to murder small boys?\n\nI don't root for these things but if God is all-good and omniscient then I trust that he knows what he is doing with his own creation.\n\n(space)\n\n&gt;Evil is contingent on good (my comment)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I don't know whether I agree. But, I think a maximally evil god would create a universe of even greater suffering and human bodies that give us even greater pain. In fact, he might even make us immortal for endless suffering.\n\nhe wouldn't be maximal then, since if that God needed other beings in order to maximize his evilness then that God's properties are dependent upon creatures and he wouldn't be a necessary being but, like us, would be contingent.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;No need. I don't believe in scapegoating. I don't believe we can be sure Jesus existed. Maybe yes. Maybe no. But, yet another self-proclaimed messiah or prophet is irrelevant.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Do you want me to explain my reasons for gnostic atheism? Probably not.\n\nWell I was more so going to go into 5 historical facts that even the most skeptical scholar grants regarding Jesus' resurrection (one of which being that Jesus was crucified in which skeptical scholar John Dominic Crossan says: \"That he was crucified is as sure as anything historical can ever be.\") I'd be happy to list them out real quick and then you can ask about them.\n\n&gt;How do you think the 32 virgins were given as a tribute to God?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I didn't come to a conclusion. I said presumably.\n\nMy apologies, I should've caught that.\n\nAs previously mentioned the Bible doesn't go into specifics much however I would assume it was much like this passage:\n\n&gt;\u201cConsecrate to me every firstborn male. The first offspring of every womb among the Israelites belongs to me, whether human or animal.\u201d (Exodus 13:2)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;or  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\"You shall not delay to offer from the fullness of your harvest and from the outflow of your presses. The firstborn of your sons you shall give to me. You shall do the same with your oxen and with your sheep: seven days it shall be with its mother; on the eighth day you shall give it to me.\u2019 (exodus 22)\n\nWhatever the case, I certainly do not think they sacrificed or killed the women as God was against that:\n\n&gt;You shall not worship the Lord your God in that way, for every abominable thing that the Lord hates they have done for their gods, for they even burn their sons and their daughters in the fire to their gods.

Those have merit but I can't build a logical argument around them. Do you have a different view? \n\n&gt;Argument from authority - An argument from authority (argumentum ab auctoritate), also called an appeal to authority, or argumentum ad verecundiam, is a form of argument in which the opinion of an authority on a topic is used as evidence to support an argument. Some consider that it is used in a cogent form if all sides of a discussion agree on the reliability of the authority in the given context. and others consider it to always be a fallacy to cite an authority on the discussed topic as the primary means of supporting an argument.\n\nI'm sharing info -- not saying that because the American Academy of Pediatrics, etc., says it, it's true. You can counter with your own stats if you like or if you don't think the American Academy of Pediatrics is reliable. A good mix of stats from various sources would be the best way to find the truth in this situation, actually. As you pointed out, studies are not infallible and the proper interpretation of data and the significance granted to different variables affects how accurate they are. \n\n&gt;Webcam work and porn has its own risks, but I wager the rate of murder for those types of sex workers is a lot less than the statistic you used. Mentioning other types of sex work is vital for the conclusion of the argument, as it pertains to my previous claim that sex work can be empowering. I figure the sex workers you're mentioning are actual prostitutes (whether legal or illegal), transacting money for sexual intercourse.\n\nYes, I can concede that. The article I referenced actually mentioned that murder rates have gone down with the rise of \"virtual\" work. The actual empowerment women receive from sex work is still suspect. I've heard personal stories, but those can only prove so much -- some women who have done stripping or webcam work felt objectified and experienced negative psychological effects like low self-esteem -- definitely not empowerment. Some women who have done stripping or webcam work felt like they gained self-esteem from the positive attention they received, which does sound like empowerment. I couldn't find a study about \"contactless\" sex work to try to get a wider view of the issue, but a study in Psychology of Men &amp; Masculinity found that pornography use, in addition to toxic masculinity and other factors, predicted a real-life objectification of women and unwanted sexual advances. Not all of the men who interact with sex workers devalue them, but the relation of pornography to negative, non-empowering real-life interactions with women is worrisome.\n\n&gt;Hasn't it been proven human males are sexually aggressive and start developing before the age of consent? Even with the perceived 'pressure of social stimuli', sexual desire is innate. I believe denying sexual identity is weakening. Control over your sexual nature is empowering, and I doubt you can significantly prove sexual abandon with WAP.\n\nJust going off of what I know and not looking it up, I believe you're right; human males are likely sexually aggressive before the accepted age of consent and one of the main hormones responsible for that, of course, testosterone, is pumped into their bodies in significant amounts throughout puberty. You're arguing that WAP doesn't cause unwanted sexual demands or activity, I believe? I think a direct link would be almost impossible to scientifically prove. We'd have to survey lots of listeners and ask them what they thought about WAP, how their sexual activity increased/decreased, etc. We can only go with probabilities, as you mentioned at the beginning of your post. The probability is that a song like WAP, produced by a role model in a young woman's life, is going to influence her thoughts and behavior (basing this probability on the AAP 2006 study). \n\nCardi B herself recognizes this to some degree -- in 2017 she said, \"I realized, after Halloween, a lot of little girls, they be looking up to me. They love me and I\u2019m thinking to myself, like, 'Yo, I really need to be a better example. But I be trying to be a better example, though, you know what I\u2019m saying? I\u2019ve been trying to be more PG-13, less rated R. But I be hanging out with my hood rat friends and then they fuck me up all over again.\" A few years later, a young female fan said to her on Twitter, \"I love you ALOT but I don't agree with the messages you've been sending us young girls. So many of us look at you as a role model and that should send a very loud message.\" Cardi B said in reply that, in essence, she basically just wanted to be herself.\n\nTake from that what you will. Cardi B does not actually market herself to teens, but keeping teens from her music is probably a losing game. Cardi B is a public figure and the song in question can encourage sexual behavior that is not likely to be empowering. Society is already a difficult place for women and teen girls, and WAP seems like another disempowering message for those women struggling to be respected and seen as human, not as a collection of sexual parts.", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "comment_type": null, "created_utc": 1611303654, "gildings": {}, "id": "gk5o19z", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_l0pbac", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t1_gk2yhtu", "permalink": "/r/changemyview/comments/l0pbac/cmv_wap_is_not_an_empowerment_song_its_just_vulgar/gk5o19z/", "retrieved_on": 1611438209, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "changemyview", "subreddit_id": "t5_2w2s8", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1611303654.0}

While there are studies which say that men cheat more,  [about 20% of men and 13% of women](https://ifstudies.org/blog/who-cheats-more-the-demographics-of-cheating-in-america#:~:text=also%20means%20infidelity.-,In%20general%2C%20men%20are%20more%20likely%20than%20women%20to%20cheat,gender%20gap%20varies%20by%20age.) the studies admit that women between the ages 18-29 seem to cheat more then men, who overtake women in cheating by their thirties. There are other studies suggesting that women cheat more, but are just more likely to get away with it, and less likely to reveal it. However the data is shaky at best and no conclusions could be drawn from it since we do not know what kind of biases lurk there.\n\nIm much more inclined to to believe the people that say that both men and women are wired to cheat on a biological level.\nFrom a survival point of view for men the more partners they mate with the more likely is their bloodline is to continue, but for even higher chance besides just mating with as many females as possible there is an additional strategy, to mate with a single female and put your energy on the survival of that mates child.\nFor females however the strategy of mating with everything that moves doesn't work, so they have to be selective to find the best genes around, however just finding the best genes is only half the work as the other half is to secure a mate who is going to support you and your child. And those two are often not the same.\nI do not believe that cheating is a male or female trait rather a evolutionary mechanism to ensure the survival of your bloodline in which we betray our partner in order to ensure the continuation of your genetic code.", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "comment_type": null, "created_utc": 1611297936, "gildings": {}, "id": "gk5hmri", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_l28te4", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t3_l28te4", "permalink": "/r/PurplePillDebate/comments/l28te4/men_would_hate_it_if_women_had_a_male_sexuality/gk5hmri/", "retrieved_on": 1611434035, "score": 2, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "PurplePillDebate", "subreddit_id": "t5_2ya42", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1611297936.0}

It's only fair since you spent your time writing to share with us, and honestly it's just nice to reflect back on those moments. This is probably going to end up a long as well since it's easy to get carried away in the details and I have to provide context haha. The first time I tripped I was being watched by my bestfriend at the time. It had been a coincidence that the lyric video for \"A Little Piece of Heaven\" by Avenged Sevenfold we were watching was released like 8 years prior on the exact same day (Sept 24th) and it was one of our favorite songs. I wasn't even tripping yet at that point but it got me excited, and that was one of the first synchronistic moments of my life. We decided to go walk around and we visited the old middle school we went to, hung out on the bleachers, admiring how the sun set and I started feeling it as we were smoking some bud out of a pipe down in the baseball dugout. I had a small portable speaker with us the entire time and even though that thing had a red light almost the whole duration, it never died. We walked through the park at dusk with \"Rotten Apple\" by Alice in Chains playing, it gave me such a surreal feeling and I think back to that moment first when I think of this trip. I should also mention that I am transgender (female to male), and at this point I had been out to the people in my life but it was still an incredibly dark place mentally. Everyday I felt so suicidal and so far down in the hole when I reflect on those times, it's a wonder I made it. However acid helped me accept the parts of me I felt I couldn't eventually. Now it didn't happen with just one trip in one night, obviously and took time and my own acceptance and support from others. Whenever I tripped after that and was no longer in awe from the first time, I just felt more displaced in my body (than usual). It was like my soul really wanted to claw out and I felt this from my core of my being when I tripped. I got on horomones at the beginning of 2018 and each time I tripped after having physical progression, such as my body fat shifting all over, deeper voice, you know regular male puberty shit. Each time I would look at myself in the mirror even though they say not to, I had to. Every time I'd come back and see myself looking progressively more how I did in my head and nothing feels better than that. On one hand it was also a double edged sword because negative thoughts on acid cut deep and are analytical of everything so I would sometimes get into a loop of \"why am I even trying?\" \"People think you're an abomination\" \"No matter what you do you'll never truly be male, so is it even worth it?\" if my mind wasn't strong enough I probably would of end up hurting myself badly. Thankfully not the case. Back to the trip: Probably the most outstanding one was that summer of 18, about 6 months into my treatment when my bestfriend and I tripped together at his house and saw the most beautiful sunrise ever. We'd been waiting for this acid ALL day, but it seemed like it was just gonna be a bust. It was all rainy and grey outside, our friend who'd been staying over was bad on pills and his family had picked him up with a huge fight, there was no word from the plug. The energy just seemed to be at an all time low then fate winked at us. We ended up getting it late at night, with a snowy surprise. My bud and I were at his table smoking weed out of his pipe and he has a wooden tray, we both felt like we'd been taken back to damn stone age, everything seemed like clay and ancient. His animals (like 5 fuckin cats and 3 dogs) started to fuck with us, one of them was a fat sweaty weinerschnitzel type breed who would always whine. So we bribed him with some treats, but the sound of the bag brought ALL of the animals scattering toward us. Everyone's individual nails just clacking on the hardwood. Right. At. Us. It was hysterical and also creepy because they definitely knew. We put on Avatar, the one with the blue people, tried to watch that but the technology started to fuck with us also! The TV flashed up some weird error message, then the entire room went black, we both felt some strange energy in the air like an alien abduction lmfao. Super tripping and we just decided to go outside as it was almost 6 am at that point. It was so fucking beautiful dude, one half of the sky was so orange, yellow, so divine. The other side was colors of blue, grey and blackish, they clashed right in the middle. We were even wearing the same color scheme as the sky but standing on the opposite side like some ying yang shit. There were so fuckin many different depths of layers in these clouds, I have NEVER seen a sky look so crazy and I've tripped many times since outdoors. My bud pointed at this one cloud in the celestial portion and seemed to zoom our vision into it like a magnifying glass. We're just standing outside at the ass crack of dawn pointing to the sky like some real crackheads, barefoot as can be with no fucks given. There was a plane right above us and with the angle of the trail behind it, it really looked like we were in a fucking dome. Then my buddy is like \"dude... what if he's like a boat on top of the ocean right now and we're in a world underneath\" or something like that. Blew my fucking mind apart and my perspective was manhandled and it truly felt like I just witnessed someone jet ski over us like we're some fish. I've never seen the sky the same since, actual eye watering beautiful clouds, it made me feel lucky to of been able to witness that! I'm lucky to have many friends who are supportive of my lifestyle and to of been strong enough to tango with those demons. Of course everyday is still a battle in some way but more than ever before I feel at peace and grateful for every experience and to be able to even have this open mindedness. I've even been able to try dmt, that however blows all of this far out of the water lol! Thank you for reading this too!

The final medical treatment decisions involving the use of hormonal therapy rest with clinicians and their patients. Such treatments also require the written consent from parents (where minors are concerned).\u201d\n\n&gt; The statement was also posted on the MOE Facebook page.\n\n&gt; Ashlee\u2019s story went viral online after she first wrote about her experience with her school in an anonymous Reddit post on 14 January \u2013 she has also confirmed with Yahoo News Singapore that she authored the post.\n\n&gt; She had then accused Millennia Institute of attempting to prevent her from receiving proper medical treatment and banning her from school unless she cuts her hair in a \u201cmale\u201d style and wears the male school uniform. She was also threatened with expulsion if she wore the female uniform in school, Ashlee said.\n\n&gt; Ashlee added that she had been diagnosed with gender dysphoria by a doctor from the IMH.\n\n&gt; In the statement by the LGBTQ groups, she provided more details of her allegations. \u201cDespite having parental consent to medically transition, Ashlee was informed by her doctor in August 2020 that MOE needs him to consult and work with schools before referring any student for HRT (hormonal replacement therapy),\u201d the statement said.\n\n&gt; Hormonal therapy is a medically recognised treatment for gender dysphoria, a mental condition often suffered by transgender individuals in which they experience distress due to their gender identity not matching their sex assigned at birth. Gender dysphoria may lead to other mental conditions such as anxiety and depression.\n\n&gt; MOE had earlier released a statement on 16 January, denying that it had interfered with Ashlee\u2019s medical treatment. The ministry received criticism from netizens for misgendering Ashlee in this statement by referring to her by the male pronoun \u201chis\u201d. In the MOE-IMH statement, MOE did not respond specifically to a question by Yahoo News Singapore about the misgendering.\n\n&gt; Speaking to Yahoo News Singapore, Ashlee said of the home-based learning option, \u201cI am still considering between home-based lessons or polytechnic. There are still some discussions to be had with the school. Not everything can be done through home-based learning, such as science practicals and project work.\u201d\n\n&gt; According to a timeline of Ashlee\u2019s account provided by the LGBTQ civil society groups, \u201cOn 23 October 2020, Ashlee\u2019s school leaders and administrators met with her and her father to inform them that should Ashlee choose to receive hormone replacement therapy, it would have to be at a reduced dosage. They told Ashlee that she would be expelled if physical changes from the hormones made her no longer able to fit into the boys\u2019 uniform\u201d.\n\n&gt; On 5 November 2020, Ashlee said she was pulled out of class and reprimanded for her hair length. After returning home, the school called her father to inform him that Ashlee was not to return to school until she cut her hair, she added. The school then reportedly declined her request for home-based learning.\n\n&gt; According to the timeline, Ashlee did not return to school for the rest of the school year from 6 November 2020 to 27 November 2020. On 11 January 2021, the first day of the new school year, Ashlee said she went to school but was called up by the school administration within an hour and thrown out of the school compound because her hair length did not comply with the male dress code.\n\n&gt; On 18 January 2021, the school reportedly met with Ashlee and informed her that it would not allow her to attend classroom lessons unless she complies with the hair and uniform requirements for male students. An allowance was made for her to wear track pants and a polo shirt instead of the boy\u2019s uniform, on the condition that she agreed to cut her hair.\n\n&gt; The statement by the civil society groups said that Millenia Institute\u2019s actions denied Ashlee her right to education on the basis of her gender expression.\n\n&gt; \u201cMillennia Institute\u2019s ultimatum for Ashlee to choose between receiving an education or receiving medically necessary treatment violates her basic human rights to self-determination, privacy, personal autonomy and bodily integrity, as well as her right to education and the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health,\u201d said the statement.\n\n&gt; In response to the latest MOE-IMH statement, a spokesperson for advocacy group TransgenderSG, who has been in touch with Ashlee, said, \u201cWe are supportive of the clinical-led approach that MOE and IMH have shared in their statement, and affirm that in cases of transgender minors, parental support is critical. However, there remain gaps in how schools can create a supportive environment for transgender students or address the unique challenges that come with transitioning at school.\n\n&gt; \"TransgenderSG would be keen to engage MOE for a public-private dialogue on how schools can accommodate trans students and work towards creating inclusive educational spaces for all.\"\n\n&gt; Activists have previously called for an end to discrimination against LGBTQ people in Singapore.\n\n&gt; A survey commissioned by Yahoo News Singapore in 2019 found that four in five Singaporeans (80 per cent) agree that discrimination against the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ) community exists here.\n\n&gt; Related stories:\n\n&gt; Singapore eatery praised for LGBTQ allyship after homophobic incident in shop\n\n&gt; Christian group apologises, takes down video linking gay community to Satan\n\n&gt; Singapore's LGBTQ voters call on election candidates to end silence on queer issues\n\n&gt; Actor Chase Tan apologises to LGBTQ community for Mediacorp drama\u2019s negative gay stereotypes\n\n&gt; LGBTQ communities in Asia hit hard by pandemic restrictions\n\n&gt; High Court dismisses 3 constitutional challenges to Section 377A\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "comment_type": null, "created_utc": 1611291361, "gildings": {}, "id": "gk588h6", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_l2gg42", "locked": false, "no_follow": false, "parent_id": "t3_l2gg42", "permalink": "/r/singapore/comments/l2gg42/transgender_student_says_school_barred_her_again/gk588h6/", "retrieved_on": 1611428032, "score": 24, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "singapore", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh8c", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1611291361.0}

I have a bit of hesitation about talking about it all to straight people because there\u2019s almost a risk of demonizing the queer community in general in the process. So I\u2019m saying this with the caveat that cis-lesbians as individuals, are currently more likely to support trans people than any other non-trans demographic of people. And that makes sense being that they are both more marginalized than gay men (by being women) and straight women by being (gay.) However, certain aspects of the history of lesbian culture and identity have been entangled with some of the most viscous forms of anti-trans sentiment. And some of the most out-spoken leaders of these factions are gay women who collaborate with conservatives and allow cis-women to tokenize them in pursuit of hating trans people, especially trans women. A lot of it comes from second-wave feminism, which gay women had a really huge impact on. There were a lot of female-separatist movements, the concept of political-lesbianism (you can\u2019t be a feminist and sleep with men because they\u2019re the enemy, etc.) And also a frequent desire to \u201cabolish gender\u201d meaning to abolish the limitations that come with gender roles. And so with that, abolishing gender eventually came to mean assigning a lot of importance to biological sex. As in, your sexual orientation is about about which sex you want to sleep with. Also the idea that the identity of being a woman isn\u2019t something innate but is defined through the oppression they\u2019ve experience through because of their sex. Since we cannot change our genetic sex, it follows in this logic that you cannot become a woman and that doing so is trivializing sex-based oppression. So a lot of the complaints about trans people coming from this logic are things like \u201ctrans lesbians want to trick cos-lesbians into sex with them, but lesbians don\u2019t like dick.\u201d Or \u201ctrans women want to be part of women\u2019s spaces but didn\u2019t experience the same marginalization growing up.\u201d The dislike of trans men is a lot about feeling like trans men are really just butch lesbians who can\u2019t except themselves because of internalized misogyny. This is why you hear a lot of the time people who hate trans women associated with \u201cradical feminists.\u201d Because it comes from an (outdated) version of feminism that focuses less on individual choice and more on trying to deconstruct gender and rebuild it as purely defined by biological sex\u2014which obviously doesn\u2019t include trans people very well.\n\nTo be clear, I honestly think that these days lesbians have much less to do with perpetuating these ideas and it\u2019s much more the JK Karens of the world who are carrying this mantle forward. That\u2019s why so many boomers Xers are on this kick, it\u2019s got a lot of history in a very boomer-version of feminism. So they\u2019re really primed for it in a lot of ways.\n\nAccepting trans people requires accepting that gender exists. Meaning of that people experience a sense of identity with the concept of gender that doesn\u2019t always correlate to one\u2019s genitals, and isn\u2019t only defined by oppression or hatred of women. I\u2019m agender, meaning I don\u2019t experience any feeling of gender at all. Im also someone with XX chromosomes, so I have and continue to experience a lot of misogyny as well\u2014and it makes me very angry. So in some ways I consider myself a prime target for this sort of ideology. The idea of experiencing gender as something other than a box I\u2019ve been forced into  is hard for me to imagine or relate to. But I do identify strongly with the oppression of women, but not the an innate identity of women.  In any case, I was able to come to the conclusion that because I don\u2019t personally experience gender, \u201cgender does not exist for anybody\u201d is not the right conclusion to come to. That\u2019s the same logic in that cause the heterosexual majority to think \u201cbecause I personally find the idea of having sex with someone of my own gender it must be unnatural for everyone. \n\nBut yeah, there is a brief description of where the LGB community is coming from.

Just sharing my views. \n\n\nSo! \nChrom is a character who makes snap judgements about people. He knows in a minute who someone is, and he\u2019s most often right. That gut instinct saves his life many times. And it\u2019s not something he got out of nowhere, it was born from his dark childhood. \n\nHe meets Olivia shortly before the timeskip. He says in the supports that it\u2019s crazy for them to marry, it\u2019s fast. But he knows it to be true. And beyond that.\nHe has trouble with one on one conversations despite his great leadership; and she is painfully shy. So he gets determined to get her to talk (she\u2019s from Ferox, a neighboring country that he has good relationship with) \nHe eventually gets her talking and...suddenly he can\u2019t respond. He\u2019s shy now. But they work it out, and they learn how to talk with each other. \nShe also makes my favorite queen; using her own skills to travel the lands and mend hearts through dance, and I like that it sort of has a \u201cFirst Lady\u201d vibe of her actually having her own full campaign. \n\nBut as for Inigo, the real meat here: \n\nInigo looks just like Chrom, and is even one of 3 character sto use Chrom\u2019s color scheme. The other 2 are Chrom and Lucina. \nInigo is the 2nd child listed (behind owain, who is Chrom\u2019s nephew) (Lucina is technically first but she\u2019s listed with the adults, since she\u2019s unmissable) \n\nHe was designed based off Marth; and his birthday is a reference to Marth\u2019s...\n\nBut the biggest thing \n\nInigo is characterized by self doubt. We see it a lot, but his main takeaway as a character is insecurity and not believing in himself. Chrom had a big line in act 1 \u201cwhat if I can\u2019t? What if I\u2019m not worthy of her ideals?\u201d They share that insecurity. No other potential sibling has it. \n\nAlso, in inigos fsther support, the fsther yells at inigo...something we don\u2019t see many men do (that indignant rage) but we see it multiple times from Chrom. We even see the father compare themselves to Inigo \n\nNext up, Lucina\u2019s sibling supports...\nThe sibling goes through an arc of self doubt, comparing themselves to Lucina and Chrom, whereas the others don\u2019t really have that issue. \nThere is also a big scene about fleeing a bug and Chrom coming in angrily. Inigo is canonically afraid of bugs, none of the others are; and the scene\u2019s portrayal of the younger siblings fear just hits inigo perfectly (they all act like Laslow from Fates. Who is inigo.) \n\nAnd Lucina\u2019s mother support...\n\nMainly the dress thing. The mom is shy and such; like Olivia, but the best part is when she makes quiet remarks about the dresses and Lucina\u2019s taste. We see that wittiness mixed with lack of confidence to admit it from Olivia in her supports with some other women. \n\nInigo also has a brand; none of Lucina\u2019s othe potential siblings do so I love that. \nAnd Laslow mentions things that only really fit as the Lucina sibling; and compares himself to Chrom, something only Lucina\u2019s sibling does. \n\nThe major thing (and this part is heavily opinionated instead)\nIs my reasoning that I don\u2019t like Robin as Lucina\u2019s mom \n\nAnd if all boils down to one scene; the Grima slaying scene where Lucina confronts Robin. \n\nBasically, in any variant, no matter what, Chrom comes in and is either stopping Lucina or saying he knew she\u2019d atop, but he does in to mention that it\u2019s his fate, and he believes in bonds more than destiny. It\u2019s a big moment for Chrom and Lucina\u2019s characters (obviously. Chrom is the main character and Lucina is the secondary for a large part of the game) \n\nBut in the Robin-mom scene, Lucina stops herself, breaks down, and cries. \nHer resolve is a core part of her character. It defines her. It\u2019s used in all promotional material. But in that scene, the biggest showcase of her resolve, and her biggest scene arguably...she cried. Like any other female lead. She lost one of her biggest defining moments and replaced it with \u201cgirl breaks down and cries.\u201d\n\nAnyway, awakening and Mass Effect are my favorite games so sorry if I overtalked or you aren\u2019t interested but it\u2019s nice to talk about it now thst all my friends have heard enough and I don\u2019t get to irl lol", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "comment_type": null, "created_utc": 1611278200, "gildings": {}, "id": "gk4komc", "is_submitter": true, "link_id": "t3_l26unk", "locked": false, "no_follow": false, "parent_id": "t1_gk4ih61", "permalink": "/r/masseffect/comments/l26unk/an_unbelievable_crossover_part_12_let_me_know_if/gk4komc/", "retrieved_on": 1611413030, "score": 3, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "masseffect", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rc19", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1611278200.0}

It's interesting that you remarked about this incredibly brazen self-hatred being a markedly American feature amongst Asians who grew up in the West. I've worked in LA, San Diego and NY (granted these are very progressive and diverse areas) but the Asian communities there were always so proud of their cultures and worked very hard to preserve the authenticity of it. Of course this wasn't to say that there were absolutely no women who actively self-hated but they felt like they were in the minority or at least were subtle/mature enough about it. It's difficult (although not impossible and highly plausible) to imagine that the US with its older and higher concentration of Asian diaspora being much worse than the UK in terms of self-hatred. Weirdly enough, I feel like self-hatred and white-worship is HUGE amongst Asian women in the creative industries. Although they don't actively shit on Asian men and engage in activism to support BLM and diversity, they only ever date mediocre white guys who barely respect them and engage in very Western habits that shit on aspects of Asian culture such as filial piety and cooking so their behaviour feels wildly dichotomous. I don't know these girls personally I just have a former colleague who changed industries that I'm still in touch with who relays all this to me. I have a feeling it's because many of these girls were from unstable families which drove them to westernisation. I'm extremely lucky to have found the Asian girls I'm friendly with who didn't excessively westernise themselves - we seem to have much more in common. \n\nI think my overall fear and condescension of white guys turned me off dating them quite strongly from an early age. My white-worship manifested in wanting to exclusively having white girl friends and being around white girl gangs so I could be the \"different\" Asian girl or the \"cool\" Asian girl which makes me cringe thinking back on it. The Asian community in my childhood home was very segregated and stuck out so they were prime targets for discrimination. \n\nI fully share your past feelings, I resented the Asian guys from my school who dated white girls and felt like they ignored Asian girls. But looking back, the Asian boys never said anything derogatory about Asian girls and for the most part they were never problematic about it but you could tell it was a source of pride for them to fit in with the mainstream. Asian boys who had white girlfriends found it easier making friends in general at school. I moved to London after school finished so I never knew how they progressed and whether these boys turned into self-hating sell-out men (like their female counterparts in the dreaded WMAF partnerships), but all the girls my brothers dated were really sweet and remarkably open-minded people. Yes, they were still ignorant but out of a lack of education/exposure and they were open to learning about our culture.\n\nThat's a very healthy mindset you have there, I wish someone had told me that when I was at school.", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "comment_type": null, "created_utc": 1611277498, "gildings": {}, "id": "gk4je98", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_kzbhub", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t1_gjzxw01", "permalink": "/r/aznidentity/comments/kzbhub/asian_women_feel_threatened_now_that_asian_men/gk4je98/", "retrieved_on": 1611412233, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "aznidentity", "subreddit_id": "t5_3amv4", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1611277498.0}

I am butch so we have always had models of women who are masculine in our lives (and lesbians who are femme among my friends). Weirdly she had no idea I am queer (I'm bi and was married to her dad so it's fair enough) and doesn't connect gender presentation to that. She has also had friends pressured by her peer group to 'pick an identity' which is common - it's just it used to be about which boy band or car brand you liked. \n\nGender questioning is a thing that happens. I hit puberty like the fist of an angry god, and I hit it early, and I hated it. Hated what 'woman' meant I was supposed to be. I cute my hair off and bound my chest, even though I had no idea that trans men existed. My mother sat down and explained that I was putting myself in danger with the chest binding, but always supported me with whatever aesthetic I chose. For a long time I tried being feminine - Afterall I do it well and look good and get a lot of approval for it. But once I had my daughter it started getting harder and harder to do. I hated it more and more. So I stopped.\n\nI wasn't trans when I was a kid and I am not trans now, even if a lot of people assume I am or am gender questioning. Making space for little girls to be butch can be hard in the context of there not being a whole lot of role models, none of them also are bi or straight, and there is a tendency to assume gender questioning at certain points of female masculinity. HOWEVER it's crucial that you make sure your child knows that being trans will not result in you rejecting them or hurting them, and you will support it. The 'joke' may well be just that - a joke about the way people assume gender and gender questioning when you're gender non-conforming - but it's also possibly a tentative step towards transition. \n\nMy kid told her friends she was gay before she told me. So telling friends you're trans before your parents is normal.\n\nAs far as identity changes - nothing is permanent at this stage. Social transition - name, pronouns, clothing - is all totally impermanent. It's okay to explore that. Make sure your kid knows you love and support them if they are trans, or questioning, and be supportive. I know if I was a pre-teen now I'd have 'felt' trans in terms of popular definitions but that it have been a lot better off working through that with others than dealing with it on my own. \n\nTell your kid you love them, that if they want you to use male pronouns you will, that if they want a binder you can help pick one, that if they don't know that's okay, if they want to experiment you'll be there. See if there is a local LGBTQIA+ group that offers events or counselling, and make contact.\n\nIt's a totally different situation now to what it was and it can be weird and difficult, even for me and this is my own community!

Maybe taken Open Forum as seriously as you do Open Carry?\n\nHere, let me help educate you with sourced facts:\n\n[Conservative parents don't believe empathy and tolerance are important virtues to instill in their children (that's a bit concerning, as I thought they were the party who always invoking Jesus...).](https://www.people-press.org/2014/09/18/teaching-the-children-sharp-ideological-differences-some-common-ground/2/#about-the-american-trends-panel)\n\nLiberals believe it is important to teach Children:\n\n- Curiosity\n- Empathy\n- Tolerance\n\nWhereas Conservatives believe it's important to teach:\n\n- Obedience\n- Faith\n\nIt's right here where you see the divide being sown. Empathy\u2014a high-level emotion\u2014needs to be fostered and learned just like any high-level logic techniques. If the mother and/or father fails in doing this, it leads to long-term issues in behavioral development. [Teachers have also widely called for bolstering teaching empathy:](https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2016/10/17/497827991/a-sesame-study-in-kindness)\n\n&gt;How can a child be kind without being helpful or thoughtful? By being polite. It turns out that manners were very important to parents. When given a choice between having manners and having empathy and asked, \"Which of these is more important for your child to be right now?\" 58 percent chose manners compared with just 41 percent who chose empathy.\n\n&gt;Kotler Clarke suggests that some parents may assume that teaching a child manners is a good way of building empathy. But, she says, \"**There's really no great evidence around that. In fact, bullies are very good at having manners around adults.**\"\n\n&gt;On this point, teachers broke with parents, overwhelmingly preferring empathy (63 percent) over manners (37 percent). And teachers can see the disconnect in their classrooms. Thirty-four percent say, of the children they teach, that all or most of their parents are raising kids to be empathetic and kind, while just 30 percent say all or most parents are raising children with values consistent with their teachers'.\n\nFurthermore:\n\n- [Conservatives are responsible for the vast majority of violence in our nation's history.](https://www.reddit.com/r/lennybird/comments/gzs78b/political_violence_in_america_no_its_not_a_both)\n\n- [Conservatives / Trump supporters are the least-educated](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/education-not-income-predicted-who-would-vote-for-trump/)  [Source 2](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2016/11/18/educational-rift-in-2016-election/) [Source 3](https://www.people-press.org/2016/04/26/a-wider-ideological-gap-between-more-and-less-educated-adults/) \n\nThis is probably the source of why they think the [female body rejects rape pregnancies](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/20/us/politics/todd-akin-provokes-ire-with-legitimate-rape-comment.html), why they think [snowballs on the Senate floor disproves climate change](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3E0a_60PMR8)...\n\n- [Conservatives diversify their news the least](https://www.journalism.org/2014/10/21/section-1-media-sources-distinct-favorites-emerge-on-the-left-and-right/)\n\n- [Conservatives are less informed on history and current-events.](https://np.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/2ovu1d/factchecking_politifacts_verdict_on_jon_stewart/)\n\n- [Conservatives are less consistent in their moral foundation, having more double-standards, and greater hypocrisy.](https://www.reddit.com/r/cgtcivics/comments/79omx3/republican_voters_appear_to_enthusiastically/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=usertext&amp;utm_name=politics&amp;utm_content=t1_epd5b4t)\n\nThere is another interesting correlation, if not a causal-factor, in that those identifying as conservatives are likely to have elevated testosterone levels compared to their left-wing counterparts. Testosterone, the predominant male hormone is known to elevate rage and aggression while muting emotional sensitivities like empathy. On the surface, conservatives may cheer over this, but consider respect for a rabid wild animal / loose-cannon is not the same respect for someone posing intelligent arguments. This is why one frequently sees conservatives substituting aggression and intimidation for a lack of substantive reasoning -- [Example](https://youtu.be/ups4FeSuHvY).

Add to this that you are at your peak mental fitness\u2014you pick things up quickly. You also have more time focused on \"learning\" and being \"aware.\" You are less afraid of change, albeit perhaps naive at times, but you almost look forward to change and progress.\n\nIn older years, your free-time dwindles, your priorities change. You can no longer spend as much time reading a book and focusing on current-events. Your time is spent on immediate concerns rather than the abstract and worldly, such as:\n\n- Likely raising a family\n- Focusing on your career/work/income\n- Your mental capacity likely has deteriorated since your early years\n- Your peers are all in the same boat, which then feeds back into itself\n\nNow, instead of reading long-form journalist pieces, timely non-fictional books, researching academic journals\u2014you're limited to \"bite-sized\" pieces of news via talk radio (Rush) or TV (Fox) as you're eating breakfast before work, then you've got the evening news and your social media feed. This is all you've got. Such a shallow understanding of what's going on makes you malleable, more susceptible to \"common-sense\" rhetoric when all variables are not known to you. \n\nBecause of this, you become more shortsighted. You may be more stressed because you have a family to support, and so you become more selfish\u2014making you hate \"all the taxes\" that are impacting your bottom-line. Instead of progress, you just want things to \"stay the same,\" and be \"stable\" because it's harder to adapt in older years. No longer are you looking at the long-term game, but the immediate return. \n\nI contest the correlation with age is not a result of wisdom, but a lack of time to understand issues at depth, or await the return on investment. Compounding this:\n\n[Peak Hours Worked By Age](https://www.thebalance.com/what-is-the-average-hours-per-week-worked-in-the-us-2060631)\n\n[Educational Activities by Age](https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2017/time-spent-in-educational-activities-in-2016.htm)\n\n[Fluid intelligence degradation](http://alzheimers.emory.edu/healthy_aging/cognitive-skills-normal-aging.html)\n\n&gt;\"\u201cChrystalized\u201d intelligence, i.e., knowledge or experience accumulated over time, actually remains stable with age.  **On the other hand, \u201cfluid\u201d intelligence or abilities not based on experience or education tend to decline.**\"\n\nIn short, Occam's Razor suggests that\u2014surprise\u2014education makes you more informed, and is not some liberal conspiracy. Perhaps we need to start considering the possibility that it's not that education is biased with liberalism, but that liberalism is a result of being educated.\n\nBy the way, I say this as a former Republican conservative. But the good news is that they change! My family did! Peace, love, tolerance, curiosity\u2014these aren't exactly bad things. By the way, can you call me a bleeding heart hippie tree-hugger SJW?

Moderna, whose business historically has not involved much production, is more [reliant on third parties](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/12/17/947628608/how-will-moderna-meet-the-demand-for-its-covid-19-vaccine).\n\nFrom [this story](https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2020-12-28/covid-19-vaccine-supply-chain-delay).  \n\n\nI've also read other stories about companies looking to strike deals with manufacturer's about using their facilities. But many of those facilities have existing obligations, making vaccines against regular influenza, measles, mumps, rubella, etc. They'd have to break those contracts, exposing us to a greater risk from those diseases, and even then it might take them long weeks or even months to switch over their equipment to produce the new vaccine.  \n\n\nThere aren't a lot of medical production facilities in this nation that are sitting around doing nothing.  And you can bet that every one of them has been contacted about making vaccines. A company that can make a deal to deliver more doses basically has a license to print money, so the fact that companies are saying they can't make anymore suggests that we're dealing with practical limitations and not a problem of money.  \n\n\nTo your point about throwing money at the problem to make things go faster, the problem there is that one thing that money can't control is time. Some things just take time. Maybe we could have built more factories last year and they'd be ready to produce by now, but given the exacting standards the US sets for medicine I'm not sure about that.   \n\n\nI should be clear I'm not an expert, just a layman that has read a lot on the matter this year. So I could be wrong and the Biden administration could find a way to speed things up by throwing money at the right companies. But both logic and personal research suggests this is unlikely.

That ignores the fact that the vast majority of the people alive on the planet today have some level of genetic resistance to the flu. Why? Because most people who didn't have that resistance has died during the various influenza pandemics (and annual flu seasons) over the past century. Also, we have a vaccine for the flu every year. This provides additional resistance (to people who will take it).\n\nThat is not the case with Covid. Granted, some unknown percentage of the population seems to have some resistance (which is likely why there are so many asymptomatic cases), but roughly 3.5% of people infected with Covid require hospitalization.

Forty-four of these 49 statements were accepted. A complete list of all accepted statements is reported in tables 1 and 2. Highlighted themes of the accepted statements are included in box 1.\n\n\n**Discussion**\n\n\nThe approval of SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations in many regions worldwide creates an urgency to develop recommendations for patients with IBD and other immune-mediated diseases. The IOIBD membership is an international representation of IBD specialists and created these consensus statements to help guide the highly engaged IBD community.\n\n-----------\nThe panel recommends vaccinating all patients with IBD as soon as they are able to receive the vaccine, regardless of immune-modifying therapies. The exception is for any live-attenuated virus vaccines or replication-competent viral vector vaccines that come to market. There are many nuances that were addressed with the 44 accepted statements. The statements address the safety and efficacy of emerging vaccine types, the impact of different classes of IBD therapies on vaccination safety and response and priority of patients with IBD as compared with people without IBD. The overarching theme of these statements is that people with IBD should be vaccinated according to their overall risk of exposure to and risk of complications from SARS-CoV-2. These risks continue to be explored in registries such as Surveillance Epidemiology of Coronavirus Under Research Exclusion (SECURE) and other population-based studies.24\n-----------\n\nThere was debate around the language of statements regarding pregnancy. Due to discrepant guidance from different regions of the world,27 28 30 a decision was made to add the phrase \u2018in accordance with regional recommendations\u2019. Our statements convey that if SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations are considered safe for pregnant women without IBD, then they should be considered safe for pregnant women with IBD.\n\nA significant proportion of the live virtual meeting focused on the expected immune response to a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine while a patient is receiving immune-modifying medications. The participants endorsed the statement that people with IBD are able to mount an immune response to various vaccines, although immune-modifying therapies may partially blunt that response. This was felt not to be a reason to delay vaccination or stop immune-modifying therapies, but rather a reason to recommend counselling patients receiving systemic corticosteroids that efficacy may be decreased.\n\nSeveral questions emerge in vaccinating patients with IBD against COVID-19. Will the vaccines\u2019 effectiveness be affected by IBD medications? Will the vaccines be as safe on a background of immunosuppression? Efficacy of the vaccines has been measured as cases of COVID-19 following immunisation (generally a week or two after the booster dose).16 34 Immunogenicity is measured as neutralising antibodies and/or T-cell responses to the spike protein.5 Prospective registries of patients with IBD receiving SARS-CoV2 vaccines are urgently needed to measure the amplitude and duration of immune responses across different vaccine platforms. However, experience with previous vaccines in this patient population can edify a strategy now.\n\n-----------\n\nCorticosteroid, immunomodulator and/or anti-TNF treatment are associated with suboptimal vaccine response. Patients with IBD on infliximab or adalimumab have decreased antibody titers and lower seroconversion rates compared with controls in response to the inactivated influenza virus,21 subunit pneumococcal pneumonia9 12 and HBV vaccines.35 This response may be further blunted by thiopurines and methotrexate either given alone or in combination with anti-TNF therapy.36 Depending on the antigen, higher dose influenza vaccine was associated with higher antibody levels in patients with IBD on anti-TNFs compared with the standard dose,37 suggesting that patients on these medications may benefit from vaccine regimen modification strategies. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis on the JAK inhibitor tofacitinib mounted a normal antibody response against the influenza vaccine and a diminished response to the pneumococcal vaccine, which was not improved on temporary drug discontinuation.38 IL12/23 blockade with ustekinumab does not seem to alter vaccine response to either the influenza39 or pneumococcus vaccine40 and may show higher antibody responses in the case of the HBV vaccine.41 Similarly, patients with IBD treated with vedolizumab did not have altered immune responses to the influenza vaccine.37 However, vedolizumab treatment did result in diminished vaccine efficacy in response to an oral cholera vaccine42 and may reduce efficacy of mucosally delivered vaccines, which may be relevant for some SARS-CoV-2 vaccines currently in development.5 Because of the size of these IBD cohorts, the actual efficacy of vaccines to prevent disease even in patients who did not achieve threshold titres is not known.\n\n-----------\n\nThe current vaccines in phase 2/3 studies for SARS-CoV-2 have achieved high levels of antibody responses (IgG) and T cell responses (mRNA, AdV) against the spike protein. It is not currently known what the threshold titres should be to achieve protection. While most current vaccines given to patients with IBD use recombinant proteins, several of the leading COVID-19 vaccines use mRNA-based technology (Pfizer, Moderna) or non-replicating adenoviral vectors expressing the spike protein (AstraZeneca/Oxford, J&amp;J, Sinovac, Sputnik V). These vaccines are reported to elicit robust spike protein-specific antibody responses as well as CD4+ and CD8+T cell response.43 Evidence suggests that both B and T cell-mediated immunity are needed for optimal protection against COVID-19.31 44\u201346 There are also several inactivated (Sinopharm, Sinovac) and protein subunit vaccines (Novavax) either in phase 3 studies or recently authorised for use in several countries. In terms of immunogenicity, inactivated and vector-based vaccines seem to have the lowest immunogenicity, with mRNA and protein-based vaccines (with adjuvants) having higher antibody titres.31\n\nLive attenuated as well as replication-competent viral vector vaccine candidates are in preclinical testing or entering phase 1/2. There is concern that replication-competent vaccines may cause illness in immunocompromised hosts. At present, vaccine studies have excluded immunocompromised adults, children and pregnant women, although some women became pregnant during the trials. Because the leading vaccine candidates elicit strong antibody responses, it is expected that patients with IBD will develop protective immunity from any of these vaccine strategies in spite of immune-modifying medications. The role of checking titres or providing booster doses for low titres has yet to be determined.\n\nThe panel recognises that both the development of the statements as well as the consensus responses were limited by the lack of available data and based on expert opinion, including guidance from a vaccinologist. Despite data gaps, the global IBD patient and professional communities need guidance in the face of such uncertainty. These consensus statements are meant to inform clinical decision-making but should not replace individualised management decisions. Real-world data from registries will help generate data on vaccine outcomes in patients with IBD to inform future recommendations.\n\n**Acknowledgments**\n\nThe authors would like to thank Professor Florian Krammer for his time spent on the live webinar to educate and answer questions from the IOIBD participants, and Marischka Konings for her organisation of the programme.

Some people are very sensitive to formaldehyde, whereas others have no reaction to the same level of exposure.  \nAlthough the short-term health effects of formaldehyde exposure are well known, **less is known about its potential long-term health effects**. In 1980, [laboratory studies](https://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000044512&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English) showed that exposure to **formaldehyde could cause nasal cancer in rats**. This finding raised the question of whether formaldehyde exposure could also cause cancer in humans. In 1987, the **U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) classified formaldehyde as a probable human carcinogen** under conditions of unusually high or prolonged exposure ([1](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/substances/formaldehyde/formaldehyde-fact-sheet#r1)). Since that time, some studies of humans have suggested that formaldehyde exposure is associated with certain types of cancer. The **International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classifies formaldehyde as a human carcinogen** ([2](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/substances/formaldehyde/formaldehyde-fact-sheet#r2)). In 2011, the **National Toxicology Program**, an interagency program of the Department of Health and Human Services, **named formaldehyde as a known human carcinogen** in its *12th* *Report on Carcinogens* ([3](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/substances/formaldehyde/formaldehyde-fact-sheet#r3)).\n\n[https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/substances/formaldehyde/formaldehyde-fact-sheet#:\\~:text=When%20formaldehyde%20is%20present%20in,%3B%20nausea%3B%20and%20skin%20irritation.](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/substances/formaldehyde/formaldehyde-fact-sheet#:~:text=When%20formaldehyde%20is%20present%20in,%3B%20nausea%3B%20and%20skin%20irritation.)\n\n=======================================================================\n\n***Aluminum Hydroxide - Contained in the anthrax, DTaP, Hep B, meningococcal vaccinations***\n\nArticle AGAIN from the National Institute of Health: HUMAN HEALTH RISK ASSESSMENT FOR ALUMINIUM, ALUMINIUM OXIDE, AND ALUMINIUM HYDROXIDE\n\n&gt;From animal studies and the **clear association of aluminium** exposure and DAE, it is clear that **high levels of aluminium in CNS can lead to neurotoxicity**.

This is because:\n\n&gt;\"Experience has shown that communities faced with epidemics or other adverse events respond best and with the least anxiety when the normal social functioning of the community is least disrupted\"\n\nDonald Henderson\n\nAsking for a detailed counter plan is a mistake, because detailed plans aren't what humans have done in the past to fight pandemics. Fundamentally the only way out of a pandemic is herd immunity, achieved either by vaccines or by virus exposure, and/or the virus mutating into something less dangerous - e.g Spanish Flu - or disappearing - e.g SARS. There isn't a \"policy toolkit\" of Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions to save us from it - perhaps with the exception of a country like New Zealand, which has been able to seal itself off from the outside world. \n\nThis is a policy advocated very strongly by Dr Devi Sridhar in the UK, and I would point out that her alternative, the so called Zero Covid plan, is likewise without any details at all. Despite getting *a lot* of media attention, her plan is just as thin as the Great Barrington Declaration, although far more expansive. It includes extreme lockdowns to virtually stop community transmission until the virus has gone, then a programme of track, trace and isolate to find and stop local clusters spreading. All this done whilst the UKs borders remain tightly shut. What effect this would have on the UK's import and export sector I've no idea. What would happen on the island of Ireland I've no idea. Getting details on how these problems will be dealt with is similarly difficult. \n\nThis is the problem, without a vaccine, human's don't have much power to stop a virus. Maybe with extreme effort, coupled with lucky geography, it can be slowed, delayed or held back, but beyond that, there isn't a magic policy bullet to deal with this.

The common cold (Rhinovirus) doesn't have a widely distributed vaccine due partly to mutations, but mostly to the lack of value due to the mild nature of the virus and to an additional degree that the vaccines lose effectiveness due to the way the virus and your immune system work (the response is never particularly strong). \n\nThere is a flu vaccine and it changes regularly due to mutations and shifting percentages of strains every year. Trying to vaccinate against every strain results in very poor vaccine response, so only the most likely and dangerous strains are vaccine targets.\n\n&gt; it seems strange that a vaccine will only work that short a time \n\nIt's actually not. Your body doesn't produce lifelong antibodies to everything. Severe diseases are far more likely to create a strong response that will be remembered for a long time. Some diseases have additional behaviors that simply make them easier for your body to forget. Most vaccines are designed to trigger long-term protection, but, like diseases, some are better at doing that than others. Again, your body is not a binary mechanism and immune systems are complex.\n\nThis is one reason why many vaccines are given as multiple shots. It helps trigger a longer-lasting and stronger response to the virus.\n\n&gt;sA mutation will not be stopped by this vaccine?? Or they are expecting it mutate again?? \n\nAll of the known mutations (including the S. Africa and UK variants) appear to still be prevented by *all* the vaccines in production today. All viruses (and all life, basically) are subject to mutation. Viruses mutate more. RNA viruses tend to mutate more than DNA viruses, but Coronavirus is a bit unique in having pretty low rates of mutation. \n\nNews outlets love spreading fear of mutations, but the reality is that Coronavirus isn't a big risk for mutation in general. Right now, we're a bit worried simply because actual mutations are a result of the rate you mutate at multiplied by the number of times you replicate.

The larger the animal the less efficient, and the more wasted mass in the form of bones and other unwanted tissues.\n\n&gt; I guess you're against increasing the population of ruminants. Bc it would just be bad for the environment \n\nObviously.\n\n&gt; Does no one understand the water cycle?\n\nI'm quite familiar with the subject! Which part would you like to learn about? :)\n\n&gt; When it's used for irrigation on conventional croplams it becomes polluted with pesticides and fertilizers, it creates soil erosion.\n\nThis is a major issue, yes! For example [\"... in the United States, livestock production is responsible for 55 percent of erosion, 37 percent of all applied pesticides and 50 percent of antibiotics consumed, while the animals themselves directly consume 95 percent of our oat production and 80 percent of our corn...\"](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/is-the-livestock-industry-destroying-the-planet-11308007/). Then there's also the issue that [irrigation to grow livestock feed and keep the animals themselves alive has been causing rivers to dry up](https://modernfarmer.com/2020/03/researchers-say-american-rivers-are-getting-sucked-dry-by-beef-industry/). Ground water isn't any safer, since [aquifers are being drained so fast to keep up with the demand that the cattle industry puts on them, that now places like California have such bad land subsidence their roads and dams are beginning to fail](https://west.stanford.edu/news/blogs/and-the-west-blog/2017/save-crops-farmers-took-water-subsidence).\n\n&gt; The water is actually damaged so to speak, but it doesn't disappear.\n\nThe livestock industry is one of the worst offenders! Specifically because so many crops, including [\"70-75% of the world\u2019s soy ends up as feed for chickens, pigs, cows, and farmed fish.\"](https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/soybeans) and [those crops require such a large amount of fertilizer and dangerous pesticides, that soy production is hazardous to human and ecological health](https://unearthed.greenpeace.org/2020/02/20/brazil-pesticides-soya-corn-cotton-hazardous-croplife/). \n\nHowever that's not even looking at the amount of waste that all that food is converted into. Since [livestock outnumber humans by tens of billions](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/02/chart-of-the-day-this-is-how-many-animals-we-eat-each-year/), those [farm animals produce *far* more waste than humans](https://foodprint.org/issues/what-happens-to-animal-waste/) do: \n\n&gt; In 2012, livestock and poultry on the largest concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) produced 369 million tons of manure: this was almost 13 times more waste than that of the entire US population of 312 million. 1 While human waste is treated in municipal sewer systems and subject to strict regulation, animal waste is stored in open ponds (called lagoons) or pits and is applied untreated as fertilizer to farm fields. The mixture in lagoons consists not only of animal excrement but of bedding waste, antibiotic residues, cleaning solutions and other chemicals, and sometimes dead animals. Most lagoons are lined only with clay and can leak, allowing the waste to seep into groundwater.\n\nWhen those pollutants seep into people's drinking water livestock farms can create high enough levels of nitrites to cause [potentially deadly conditions like blue baby syndrome](https://www.wisconsinwatch.org/2015/11/nitrate-in-water-widespread-current-rules-no-match-for-it/), where infants can no longer carry oxygen in their blood. Livestock manure is also known to cause [massive river die offs](https://www.chicagotribune.com/investigations/ct-pig-farms-pollution-met-20160802-story.html) and are considered a [primary cause of ocean dead zones](https://weather.com/science/environment/news/meat-dead-zone-gulf-mexico-algae-blooms), while the GHGs like [ammonia and nitrous oxide create acid rain which is also killing off marine life](https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/GlobalWarming/story?id=2723201&amp;page=1).\n\n&gt; This is a complex issue, and soil regeneration is one of the things that are of the utmost importance. \n\nI couldn't agree more! Which is partly why I started to raise my own livestock, before I understood how damaging they could be. I'm a huge fan of regenerative and permaculture principles, but I no long believe the unscientific claims of people who tout grazing as a cure for our ecological issues, since there's many ways that it's twisted to work against nature rather than with it.\n\n&gt; Nature isn't vegan\n\nI don't think anyone's made that claim.\n\n&gt; Farms need to be treated as eco systems, not strips of land under the human domain, no matter how small you think veganism can shrink them.\n\nI... agree with that first part, but the last part? ... [Livestock use 77% of our agriculture land, yet only produces 18% of the world's calories and 37% of the world's protein supply. That means that 23% of our land is used JUST for the plants that feed humans only, yet that land provides us with 83% of our calories, and 63% of our protein](https://ourworldindata.org/agricultural-land-by-global-diets) Which kinda tells me that we could feed more people with less land, but since I'm just a rando it might be worth pointing out that [the USA is calculated to be able to feed an additional 800 million people with grain that livestock eat](https://news.cornell.edu/stories/1997/08/us-could-feed-800-million-people-grain-livestock-eat) which is only slightly shy of the [280 million people world wide who go hungry each year](https://www.who.int/news/item/15-07-2019-world-hunger-is-still-not-going-down-after-three-years-and-obesity-is-still-growing-un-report). \n\nIf you are acquainted with soil and water issues you probably understand how serious the [food waste issues compound our ecological problems, so you might be interested in this study that found:](https://www.pnas.org/content/115/15/3804) \"With a third of all food production lost via leaky supply chains or spoilage, food loss is a key contributor to global food insecurity. Demand for resource-intensive animal-based food further limits food availability. In this paper, we show that plant-based replacements for each of the major animal categories in the United States (beef, pork, dairy, poultry, and eggs) can produce twofold to 20-fold more nutritionally similar food per unit cropland. Replacing all animal-based items with plant-based replacement diets can add enough food to feed 350 million additional people, more than the expected benefits of eliminating all supply chain food loss.\"\n\n &gt;  no mechanical or chemical input (read no carbon) \n\nUm... I'm not against insects? I 100% understand how important the many species in an ecological system are, how complex everything from the worms and nematodes to the birds and [wolves](https://www.yellowstonepark.com/news/killed-wolf-increases-livestock-deaths). The problem is that [livestock farming is driving extinction of many of these important members of our ecosystems](https://www.takeextinctionoffyourplate.com/meat_and_wildlife.html) and steadily replacing wildlife.\n\n&gt; Removing one link of the farm ecosystem isn't improving it.\n\nModern farms aren't ecosystems. [Farms and ranches are what many eco-systems are replaced with](https://globalforestatlas.yale.edu/amazon/land-use/cattle-ranching). I mean. They *can* be if you grow them like we used to *before* we started monocropping to keep up with the massive demands to feed livestock. Personally I gave up on raising animals because was horrified at how much food and other supplies I had to keep buying to keep up with them, while getting almost nothing in return. Now that I've switched to vegan-only food, I've got a much more diverse food forest which produced year-round, has noticeably more wildlife which is also more diverse now that we've got the wildflowers finally able to grow without livestock eating them. We don't run out of water nearly as fast in droughts (in fact I haven't run out of collected rain water at all since I stopped raising animals for food), and my soil has started to recover from the scratching and dust bathing.", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "comment_type": null, "created_utc": 1611290671, "gildings": {}, "id": "gk5754a", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_l18rer", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t1_gk4rple", "permalink": "/r/sustainability/comments/l18rer/what_is_the_top_thing_you_wish_the_average/gk5754a/", "retrieved_on": 1611427388, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "sustainability", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qjtc", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1611290671.0}

I\u2019ve been here for a while now and I\u2019ve learned a lot over the years through trial and error. Here\u2019s where I\u2019m at today complete with reviews of the pictured products. From left to right, more or less in the order I use them. I\u2019ll mark \u2b50\ufe0f for holy grail products. I have dry, acne prone, sensitive skin. I\u2019m in my early 30s, and I live in zone 10b so quite humid most of the time and a Mediterranean climate. In the US.  I get a lot of products off yes style and I get the others from target. \n\n- Hada Labo Gokujyun Oil Cleansing \u2b50\ufe0f \nSo gentle. Unscented. Love the dispenser. This is probably my 4th bottle? I\u2019ve tried balms, I\u2019ve tried micellar water. This is my favorite in terms of how well it removes makeup (and spf though it\u2019s not as easy to see that), and in terms of the ease of use and comfort. I\u2019m probably done trying other products at this point I love this one so much. \n\n- La roche possay effaclar cleanser \nHas salicylic acid in it but isn\u2019t drying! I like this one. It\u2019s my second bottle. I\u2019ll often go for a more gentle cleanser like vanicream or the hada labo Hyluronic acid cleanser. I don\u2019t notice a drastic difference between all of them but it\u2019s comforting to know there\u2019s BHA in this fighting acne \n\n- hada labo gokujyun premium lotion \u2b50\ufe0f\nA Hyluronic acid toner. I can layer this and it really makes a difference in my hydration. I would bathe in this stuff if I could. I like the \u201cmoist\u201d formula as well, but this one is heavier. I\u2019ll use it when I shave my legs too before I put lotion on and it really makes a difference in my dryness. I have liked everything I\u2019ve tried from this line. Great for dry sensitive skin. \n\n- I\u2019m from mugwort essence \nThis is a new one for me! I just looked it up again to write this and it only has one ingredient, artemisia princeps extract. The texture is similar to Hyluronic acid and feels soothing on the skin. Smells subtly herbal, I love the smell. And no added essential oils or alcohols! I bought a small bottle to try and I think I would repurchase though I\u2019ve only been using it a few weeks.\n\n- biologique recherche lotion p50 1970\nAnother new one for me. I\u2019ve wanted to try this for years but I never wanted to go through the hoops to order it or pay for it. I really like it though! Before this I was using tarte knockout toner for my AHA which also works well for me and I would repurchase. I think I prefer this one. I have seen noticeable improvement in just a couple uses. I like the smell, it\u2019s quite medicinal though I think it would turn some people off. I believe it\u2019s the phenol in it, which has a numbing property which I\u2019m actually really into. The benefits of AHA without the sting? Yes please. I have a sneaking suspicion I\u2019ll be reordering this one in spite of the price tag. Haven\u2019t tried anything like it. \n\n- Retin-a \u2b50\ufe0f \nI got this tretonoin in Mexico. Can\u2019t get this OTC in the US. was using diffrin previously. I\u2019ve had tret prescribed to me before so I was very excited to grab this! It does work better for me than adapalene. But who can afford healthcare in the us? Retinoids are my HG for acne. And I\u2019m hoping it saves me from some wrinkles too\n\n- A\u2019pieu madecassocide cream \u2b50\ufe0f \nProbably my 4th tube. Love this one. Smells good, good texture. A little on the lighter side for me. It\u2019s not enough on its own in the winter for me. I love that it has niacinimide so I continue to use it in the winter and layer heavier stuff over it. \n\n- cerave moisturizing cream \u2b50\ufe0f \nIf I had to have only one moisturizer for the rest of my life it would be this one \n\nBonus: not pictured \n\n- Biossance 100% plant derived squalene oil \nI\u2019ll use this on top to \u201cseal it all in\u201d unscented. Gentle. Doesn\u2019t cause acne. \n\n- cerave healing ointment \u2b50\ufe0f\nA great petroleum product. I\u2019ll also use this if I\u2019m super dry to seal everything in. Great for tattoo healing too. \n\n\n****\n- I do not cleanse in the AM. I rinse with water then hyluronic acid or essence then moisturizer then SPF. \n- Double cleanse PM\n- I alternate retin a, and AHA toner every other night  with at least one break day after.

As for Salicylic acid since it\u2019s an acne drug, if a product contains more than 0.75% of it then it has to be disclosed on the label (now this is an US rule, not sure if it applies here.

I know that I need to use moisturizer but I have always struggled with this because my skin is easily made even more oily.\n\nMy routine right now: AM -- Obagi Clenziderm daily foaming cleanser (salicylic acid 2%); Paula's Choice Resist (2% BHA) exfoliant; bareminerals prime time (30 SPF)\n\nPM -- Clenziderm daily foaming cleanser (salicylic acid 2%); tiny bit of Epiduo when needed - no more than 2x weekly\n\nPlease help -- any suggestions would be appreciated! I'm looking for a good daily routine that will help clear up my acne. I have not changed my cleanser in years, but I feel as though it may be time to. I like the clenziderm because it makes my face feel extremely \"clean\" but I am just now reading on this page that that may actually not be a good thing.", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "comment_type": null, "created_utc": 1611297696, "gildings": {}, "id": "gk5hc1t", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_l1rhsw", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t3_l1rhsw", "permalink": "/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/l1rhsw/new_or_need_help_ask_here_sca_daily_help_thread/gk5hc1t/", "retrieved_on": 1611433842, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "SkincareAddiction", "subreddit_id": "t5_2tbbg", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1611297696.0}

My wisdom teeth also came in fairly dark (antibiotics can discolor developing teeth). \n\nDo not do it. Please. I normally am okay with antibiotics under reasonable circumstances, and acne is not one of them. \n\n***\n\nThe best way to treat acne is to manage the oil overproduction and inflammation. How I would go about it if I had to do it over again:\n\n- Quit being a fat fuck and listen to my body. I couldn't say \"no\" to candy. Now - my gut was already nuked badly from taking daily antibiotics for a year as a general prophylactic measure (my mom requested it, the doctor complied), so my cravings and eating habits were bad and getting worse. \n - Yeast and bacteria love the oils you produce as well as the sugars that get in your body and will grow on your skin with more oil/sugar. \n - Starve them from the inside out. It'll cut down on oil production AND cut down on inflammation. \n - What I never realized was that periods where I couldn't get candy (camping, etc), my acne died down. \n- Manage stress better. This is hard, and I'm not sure young me could have done it. AP classes, my dad dealing with lawsuits in his political position. Me discovering drugs and alcohol and managing that with the absolute fear of being caught. It was a lot. \n- Mild cleanser. No alcohol pads. No intense acne scrubs. No antibacterial shit. Just a mild scrub with a bit of salicylic acid (I've found that even though it does kill a lot of bacteria, I come out a LOT better using than NOT using). \n - A mild scrub is nice too because it will help you shed dead skin cells which, with enhanced oil production and inflammation...cause MORE inflammation, clogging of pores, and of course, pimples. \n- Drink way more water. I was a soda drinker (see point #1). Hydration, and a lot of it would have done me well. \n\n***\n\nI ended up, as a teen, taking minocycline for years. The minocycline gave me heartburn, so I took zantac. The minocycline didn't work great so I took differin and benzoyl peroxide (creams). The differin made my skin super sensitive and dry, so I suffered from sunburn (didn't help I was a dumbass), and painful dry skin (still suffer from it somewhat). \n- Shave. I love my beard, and I don't plan on getting rid of it, and I've had it in some way, shape, or form since high school. Hair wicks moisture away from your skin (this is for managing dry skin and may not apply to you). \n\n***\n\nDon't do the antibiotics unless your acne is causing you legitimate suffering in terms of career or something like that. There are ways to manage acne without going the route of something that may cause you subtle, but long term harm. \n\nAnd again - I'm not an \"anti-antibiotics\" dude - I just really think that acne is not a good enough reason to take them.", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "comment_type": null, "created_utc": 1611282910, "gildings": {}, "id": "gk4tdrj", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_l264iq", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t3_l264iq", "permalink": "/r/HumanMicrobiome/comments/l264iq/doctor_prescribed_me_doxycycline_hyclate_100mg/gk4tdrj/", "retrieved_on": 1611418593, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "HumanMicrobiome", "subreddit_id": "t5_3jkl6", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1611282910.0}

The VA-MENGOC-BC vaccine proved safe and effective in randomized double-blind studies,[33][34][35] but it was granted a licence only for research purposes in the United States[36] as political differences limited cooperation between the two countries.[37]\n\n2  A MenB vaccine was approved for use in Europe following a positive recommendation from the European Union's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, Bexsero, produced by Novartis, received a licence from the European Commission.[38] However, deployment in individual EU member countries still depends on decisions by national governments. In July 2013, the United Kingdom's Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) issued an interim position statement recommending against adoption of Bexsero as part of a routine meningococcal B immunisation program, on the grounds of cost-effectiveness.[39] This decision was reverted in favor of Bexsero vaccination in March 2014.[40] In March 2015 the UK government announced that they had reached agreement with GlaxoSmithKline who had taken over Novartis' vaccines business, and that Bexsero would be introduced into the UK routine immunization schedule later in 2015.[41]\n\nIn November 2013, in response to an outbreak of B-serotype meningitis on the campus of Princeton University, the acting head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) meningitis and vaccine preventable diseases branch told NBC News that they had authorized emergency importation of Bexsero to stop the outbreak.[42] Bexsero was subsequently approved by the FDA in February 2015.[43] In October 2014, Trumenba, a serogroup B vaccine produced by Pfizer, was approved by the FDA.[2]", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "comment_type": null, "created_utc": 1611330843, "gildings": {}, "id": "gk6xvlq", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_l1xeoy", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t1_gk6qdpz", "permalink": "/r/cuba/comments/l1xeoy/cuba_expects_to_manufacture_100_million_doses_of/gk6xvlq/", "retrieved_on": 1611463351, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "cuba", "subreddit_id": "t5_2r74v", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1611330843.0}

I do appreciate your reply.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;If you don't trust LDAPS, you can't really trust HTTPS either.\n\nI don't trust  exposing LDAPS to the internet. The protocol itself isn't the issue. Just as I would not place an HTTPS web server from my LAN to the internet without other measures in place. AD is a bit different than a basic HTTPS example in that for it to be useful, even a RODC in a DMZ still requires SOME open ports back to my other DCs, and by its nature is dealing in sensitive information. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;While tunneling important data through encryption may not seem ideal, we do it all the time. And I don't see this changing too much.\n\nWe do, all the time.  But we don't accept unsolicited inbound communications all the time without some pretty vetted infrastructure in place, do we? I think that is what I'm trying to get at. Is it possible to make this insane proposal of theirs work in a way that would be trustworthy.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;With that said, I would never allow a 3rd party to hit our internal LDAPS through some wide open Internet access. If the 3rd party wants to do LDAPS requests, we'd do a whole lot to secure that. \"whole lot\" could mean private VPN connect, could mean IP whitelisting (worst case).... but in that last case, might mean proxied LDAPS involved as well.\n\nAs it is presented, it is a ridiculous proposal from the vendor that is completely unacceptable. Part of what I also need to do is decide if managing 45 accounts in an EHR is a better use of my  time (also something I can possibly delegate)  than setting up the infrastructure (and ongoing maintenance) to mitigate the risks of this proposal.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Internally (on your network), LDAPS is the \"way\" to do auth generically. And oddly enough, as Microsoft makes more changes, we're finding that non-Windows devices are dropping AD membership auth in favor of LDAPS (e.g. VMware, Pulse, etc.).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;It is the industry standard.\n\nSure, I look for ways to do this everywhere I can **internally**. If I was implementing a local installation of 3rd part software, yes. And I would still have other security measures in place between AD and the software. The proposal as it stands *explicitly suggested that nothing else was needed from me except allowing LDAPS to the internet.* This is highly irresponsible, especially from a healthcare software provider. That is NOT an industry standard practice. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;When I think of SAML, usuallly I'm talking about a better way of handling something that is Internet based. But, certainly could be used on the interior as well. But at the end of the day, there are still trusts involved.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;You know, a lot of those SAML integrations have other pieces that \"integrate\" that are far more scary than LDAPS. Talking about Okta, ServiceNow, etc.. even Azure to an extent.\n\nSAML (in the few implementations I've done) does not require unsolicited inbound connections to be established. All communications were initiated by the browser. No one could port scan and 'see' that I had SAML/ADFS services. No AD credentials were sent over the internet.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Internet wise, I'd put as much air gap as possible between any exposed Internet service you might have and AD auth of any kind (that is, avoid if possible). Usually, Microsoft gets a \"free ride\", because, well, we'll expose everything we have if it means we get the \"Microsoft Experience\". Just saying.

This is fact. Had Yoda not denied his request to battle The Senate with typical Jedi arrogance, Obi-Wan could have defeated Palpatine in the Senate building, which housed a variety of different altitudes; this was designed so that the Chancellor could always have the moral high ground in political debates. But Obi-wan didn't fight The Senate, and Yoda soon learned that you can't cleave the Sheev in a normal 1v1. It took the Tusken Raiders years of conflict against Old Ben Kenobi to grasp his superiority in terrain advantage, as you see them visibly flee in ANH when they realize he holds the low (inverse-high) ground; this was the optimal strategy against a near-invincible opponent.\n\nYoda is shorter than virtually every other fighter, which gives him a permanent low-ground disadvantage; however, his saber-fighting style utilizes a flipping-heavy technique in order to negate this weakness for a temporary window. You'll notice that, after falling from the central podium in The Senate's building, he immediately retreats upon realizing he is on the lowest ground. You'll also notice that, while training Luke, he rides on him like a mount, to gain the intellectual high ground and accelerate Luke's training. Example D . Obi-Wan's defensive Form III lightsaber style synergizes with his careful military maneuvers; as he only strikes when prepared, he can always hold the strategic high ground. (The business on Cato Neimodia doesn't count.) You'll come to realize that this is why Commander Cody's artillery strike failed against Obi-Wan, when hundreds of Jedi were killed in similar attacks. Cody failed to grasp the strategic situation, as the Jedi Master's elevation was superior to his by hundreds of meters, making him virtually unkillable. (You'll notice that all the Jedi killed in Order 66 were on level ground with the clones, thereby assuring their demise.) Had Cody taken his time and engaged the Jedi on even terrain, he would have succeeded. Obi-Wan subsequently retreated under the surface of the lake, so that he could maintain the topographical low/high ground. This is why Obi-Wan is so willing to fight against impossible odds to the point where he thrusts himself in immediate danger; when your probability of victory is 1-to-10, you have the statistical (and therefore strategic) low ground, a numerical advantage when you use your point of view to flip the value to 10/1 . Almost losing is, in Obi-Wan's case, certain victory. (See Example E).\n\nAs we all know, spinning is a good trick. However, only the Chosen One can spin outside of a starfighter. Palpatine tried spinning, but he lost due to this technique (but this was intentional, as losing gave him the emotional high ground when Anakin arrived). The reason for this is that spinning provides a yin-yang approach to combat (based in Eastern philosophy on balance), giving the spinner the high ground from above and below. Only the Chosen One can master the spin, as it is their destiny to maintain balance in the universe. This is why Obi-Wan was so emotional after defeating Vader on Mustafar; he expected to lose the high ground to the spin, but Anakin fell to the dark side and could no longer use his signature trick, becoming the very thing he swore to destroy. Additionally, Anakin told Obi-Wan that, from \"[his] point of view, the Jedi are evil\". This broadens Anakin's mind to the concept of relativity in the context of the moral high ground, a mere step away from tactical comprehension.\n\nAnakin doesn't hate sand for the reasons he told Padme; all Jedi hate sand, as the battlefield can rapidly change between low and high ground on multiple vectors, so your perspective must be from a certain three-dimensional point of view in order to comprehend who holds the high ground. This is the only reason why Obi-Wan killed Maul in Rebels. This is also the reason why Obi-Wan hates flying; there is no gravity in space, therefore there is no high or low ground from any frame of reference (This also negates the spinning trick, as noted in Example F).\n\nIn ANH, Vader proves his newfound mastery by engaging Obi on perfectly even ground. However, Obi-Wan intentionally sacrifices himself on the Death Star, so that he could train Luke from a higher plane of existence, thereby giving him the metaphysical high ground Example G.\n\nWhy was Vader so invested in the construction and maintenance of the Death Star? Because he knows Obi-wan can't have the high ground if there's no ground left. Image A. As seen through the events of the Clone Wars, Obi-Wan was known to be on friendly terms with Senator Organa, whose homeworld held large quantities of mountainous terrain, the perfect habitat for a Jedi Master. Grand Moff Tarkin was already in position to destroy Alderaan as a first target, as the distance from Scarif to Alderaan was too vast to reach between the escape and recapture of the Tantive IV, even at 1.0 lightspeed. Alderaan had been the initial target all along, as Obi-Wan with the high ground was the primary threat to the Death Star. How? Because a moon-sized space station would have some form of gravitational pull, thereby negating Obi-Wan's zero-gravity weakness; Obi-Wan with the perpetual high-ground in a low-orbit starfighter would easily be able to fire proton torpedoes through a ventilation shaft, although the Empire was uncertain of the specific weakness of the Death Star planted by Galen Erso (who was a good friend).\n\nIn Return of the Jedi, you can see that the Throne Room contains a variety of different altitudes; Palpatine placed these there to ensure Vader's defeat. However, Sheev failed to realize that his weakness was no ground, and should have covered that useless gaping pit which does nothing\n\nA common misconception is the idea of a 'prostrate position' version of the high ground, wherein Obi-Wan lies flat on his back, giving him tactical superiority from his point of view. However, this strategy is futile, as for the high ground to come into effect, there must be a differential between parties on both the x-axis and y-axis to a moderately significant variation from both absolutes (Angles only a Sith would deal in). For Obi-Wan's high ground powers to be in full effect, he must stand between 15 and 75 degrees (\u03c0/12 to 5\u03c0/12 radians) diagonal from his opponent(s) on any quadrant of the area circle; this has been dubbed the Trigonometric Perspective Diagram. (Diagram B). The total effect for conventional high ground advantage can be calculated via the MetaComm Equation, or f(x) = lim 0\u2192x \u03c0/12 | 7\u03c0/12 5\u03c0/12 | 11\u03c0/12 \u01a9(x) (2tan(x) / 3sin(x) + (log10\u0394)) * c\u03a6\n\n\u0394 = distance on hypotenuse (meters)\n\n\u03a6 = Surrounding Force [c (variable) * \u03b2 (Earth Gravity) * (pressure (psi)/2.2)]\n\n'x' refers to the angle of contact between the two parties on, with advantage being based purely on position on the Y-axis, as the vast majority of force users base their perception on elevation rather than spacial relativity.\n\nThe power of gravitational force has great effect on the high ground; too weak, and the high ground holds no traction; too strong and the ground becomes the real enemy. Experimentation has proven that the high ground typically holds significant value between .8 and 1.4 \u03b2 (Earth Gravities) with maximum impact standing roughly equal to 1.05.\n\nPressure is equally important, as it is a surrounding force attached to gravity (the high ground has famously low impact in aquatic environments). Pressure(\u03bb) is measured in pounds per square inch (psi), to be used as a gravity multiplier (or division if pressure is sub-atmospheric; \u03a6 (Surrounding Force) is a variable defined as \u03b2 * 2.2\u03bb , with no metric value assigned due to its singular application in the MetaComm equations.\n\nIn situations regarding Obi-Wan and his relativistic point of view, you must substitute the Quadrilateral MetaComm Equation (the Jedi Master function), f(x) = lim 0\u2192x minmax\u01a9 (2tan(x) / 3sin(x) ) * (1.2)c\u03a6 [min = (|cos(x)| = 1) | (|sin(x)| = 1) + \u03c0/12 ), max = (|cos(x)| = 1) | (|sin(x)| = 1) + 5\u03c0/12 ].\n\nThe viable \u03a6 field is expanded, as Obi-Wan has taken advantage of the high ground.", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "comment_type": null, "created_utc": 1611357844, "gildings": {"gid_1": 1}, "id": "gk9ac8t", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_l2s9cp", "locked": false, "no_follow": false, "parent_id": "t1_gk95iz3", "permalink": "/r/PrequelMemes/comments/l2s9cp/the_high_ground/gk9ac8t/", "retrieved_on": 1611502683, "score": 113, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "PrequelMemes", "subreddit_id": "t5_3i60n", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 1, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1611357844.0}

Kibbe uses words in ways that don't necessarily comport with our understanding of what those words mean.

Kibbe's system is about dressing for your body, not about your personal style, and NO ONE has a \"bad\" type in Kibbe.

This is fact. Had Yoda not denied his request to battle The Senate with typical Jedi arrogance, Obi-Wan could have defeated Palpatine in the Senate building, which housed a variety of different altitudes; this was designed so that the Chancellor could always have the moral high ground in political debates. But Obi-wan didn't fight The Senate, and Yoda soon learned that you can't cleave the Sheev in a normal 1v1. It took the Tusken Raiders years of conflict against Old Ben Kenobi to grasp his superiority in terrain advantage, as you see them visibly flee in ANH when they realize he holds the low (inverse-high) ground; this was the optimal strategy against a near-invincible opponent.\n\nYoda is shorter than virtually every other fighter, which gives him a permanent low-ground disadvantage; however, his saber-fighting style utilizes a flipping-heavy technique in order to negate this weakness for a temporary window. You'll notice that, after falling from the central podium in The Senate's building, he immediately retreats upon realizing he is on the lowest ground. You'll also notice that, while training Luke, he rides on him like a mount, to gain the intellectual high ground and accelerate Luke's training. Example D . Obi-Wan's defensive Form III lightsaber style synergizes with his careful military maneuvers; as he only strikes when prepared, he can always hold the strategic high ground. (The business on Cato Neimodia doesn't count.) You'll come to realize that this is why Commander Cody's artillery strike failed against Obi-Wan, when hundreds of Jedi were killed in similar attacks. Cody failed to grasp the strategic situation, as the Jedi Master's elevation was superior to his by hundreds of meters, making him virtually unkillable. (You'll notice that all the Jedi killed in Order 66 were on level ground with the clones, thereby assuring their demise.) Had Cody taken his time and engaged the Jedi on even terrain, he would have succeeded. Obi-Wan subsequently retreated under the surface of the lake, so that he could maintain the topographical low/high ground. This is why Obi-Wan is so willing to fight against impossible odds to the point where he thrusts himself in immediate danger; when your probability of victory is 1-to-10, you have the statistical (and therefore strategic) low ground, a numerical advantage when you use your point of view to flip the value to 10/1 . Almost losing is, in Obi-Wan's case, certain victory. (See Example E).\n\nAs we all know, spinning is a good trick. However, only the Chosen One can spin outside of a starfighter. Palpatine tried spinning, but he lost due to this technique (but this was intentional, as losing gave him the emotional high ground when Anakin arrived). The reason for this is that spinning provides a yin-yang approach to combat (based in Eastern philosophy on balance), giving the spinner the high ground from above and below. Only the Chosen One can master the spin, as it is their destiny to maintain balance in the universe. This is why Obi-Wan was so emotional after defeating Vader on Mustafar; he expected to lose the high ground to the spin, but Anakin fell to the dark side and could no longer use his signature trick, becoming the very thing he swore to destroy. Additionally, Anakin told Obi-Wan that, from \"\\[his\\] point of view, the Jedi are evil\". This broadens Anakin's mind to the concept of relativity in the context of the moral high ground, a mere step away from tactical comprehension.\n\nAnakin doesn't hate sand for the reasons he told Padme; all Jedi hate sand, as the battlefield can rapidly change between low and high ground on multiple vectors, so your perspective must be from a certain three-dimensional point of view in order to comprehend who holds the high ground. This is the only reason why Obi-Wan killed Maul in Rebels. This is also the reason why Obi-Wan hates flying; there is no gravity in space, therefore there is no high or low ground from any frame of reference (This also negates the spinning trick, as noted in Example F).\n\nIn ANH, Vader proves his newfound mastery by engaging Obi on perfectly even ground. However, Obi-Wan intentionally sacrifices himself on the Death Star, so that he could train Luke from a higher plane of existence, thereby giving him the metaphysical high ground Example G.", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "comment_type": null, "created_utc": 1611300427, "gildings": {}, "id": "gk5kkm2", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_l2df69", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t1_gk5iqxs", "permalink": "/r/dankmemes/comments/l2df69/damn/gk5kkm2/", "retrieved_on": 1611435937, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "dankmemes", "subreddit_id": "t5_2zmfe", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1611300427.0}

I think that one cannot exist without the other. I even think that the people with the darkest ugliness hold the brightest beauty inside. The question is: which of the two do you decide to give the upper hand.\n\n'Decide'. It's just a word with a flagrant disregard for the complexity of the matter. At the end of the day I think being human is mostly creating and maintaining a certain balance. It is okay to be gloomy every now and then, but others will enjoy you as your brighter self more. So if you feel sad, angry, melancholy, anything you feel when darkness tips the scales, don't be afraid to grant yourself whatever you need to manage.\n\nAs a creative type, I think many art forms thrive on both darkness and light. Expressing yourself, either alone or with others who understand your pain, can be an excellent way to turn any feeling into something beautiful. Even if you cannot appreciate it yourself, it's an excellent way to cope with your difficult moments, just until the easier tides roll in.\n\nI can only recommend that you try to explain to those around you what juggling these emotions does to you and ask them for help in order to make your light shine bright and turn your darkness into something ethereal rather than a nightmare.\n\nYin and yang. Embrace the duality of your being, but try to be a little easier on yourself when the sine wave, created by the rollercoaster of emotions, comes over the crest to free fall down and listen to your heart when those steep hills need to be climbed.\n\nAny time you need to talk, know that there are people who want to listen. I know what you are going through, even though I don't think I've ever experienced it in the same magnitude. To me, getting strength out of powerful emotion, good or bad, is the best way to manage. But sometimes, I just wanna be alone. I just wanna stare into the distance. I just want time to pass me by for a while until I can face the world again. And that's okay. Nobody can tell me that it is not.\n\nSurround yourself with those that at least try to understand and see the light in you and are willing to nurture those talents. But don't be afraid to isolate yourself when necessary, either.\n\nAgain, as flawed as you think you might be, you are only defined in the grand scheme of things. You are not just your actions, your own perception of yourself. You are also a beautiful individual, everyone is in their own way.

The theory a lot of people have is that the amount of spiritual energy released in that battle caused some of the spirit wilds to re-emerge in Republic City.

Raava can still cause trouble for her, since chaos is still chaos, it can still be destructive without being evil, but ultimately embracing it and truly bringing balance to the spirits (completing an arc started with Aang) would then have given us a grey area Vaatu, who would still be just as necessary, but not evil. \n\nInstead, we get the AtLA version of Aku and season 2 lacks any nuance at all, with unnecessary evil trying to drag the plot forward while retconning a lot of shit.", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "comment_type": null, "created_utc": 1611277151, "gildings": {}, "id": "gk4irbr", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_l1mf2x", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t1_gk4dzv6", "permalink": "/r/TheLastAirbender/comments/l1mf2x/facts/gk4irbr/", "retrieved_on": 1611411845, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "TheLastAirbender", "subreddit_id": "t5_2rybx", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "created": 1611277151.0}
